<h3><a name="courseoverview"></a>Course Overview</h3>

<p><em>Description:</em> Introduction to global warming and climate change, covering the basic science, projected impacts, and approaches to mitigation.<br>
	<em>Prerequisites:</em> MATH 110 or MATH 140 or STAT 200</p>

<p>Human-caused climate change represents one of the great environmental challenges of our time. As it is inextricably linked with issues of energy policy, a familiarity with the fundamentals of climate change is critical for those looking to careers in the energy field. To appreciate the societal, environmental, and economic implications of policies governing greenhouse gas emissions, one must understand the basic underlying science. METEO 469 serves to lay down the fundamental scientific principles behind climate change and global warming. A firm grounding in the science is then used as a launching point for exploring issues involving climate change impacts and mitigation. METEO 469 will introduce you to the basic information necessary for understanding Earth's climate, including the relevant atmospheric processes, and aspects of other key components of the climate system such as the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. You will learn how to do basic computations and to use theoretical models of the climate system of varying complexity to address questions regarding future climate change. You will explore the impacts of various alternative greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and investigate policies that would allow for appropriate stabilization of future greenhouse gas concentrations. The structure of the course roughly parallels the treatment of the subject matter by the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), focusing first on the basic science, then on the future projections and their potential impacts, and, finally, on issues involving adaptation, vulnerability, and mitigation. METEO 469 will combine digital video, audio, simulation models, virtual field trips to online data resources, text, and interactive quizzes that provide instantaneous feedback.</p>

<h3><a name="whatweexpectofyou"></a>What We Expect of You</h3>

<p>On average, most students will need to spend eight to ten hours per week working on course assignments. Your workload may be more or less, depending on your prior experience with computing and the Web.</p>

<p>We have worked hard to make this the most effective and convenient educational experience possible. The Internet may still be a novel learning environment for you, but, in one sense, it is no different than a traditional college class: how much and how well you learn is ultimately up to you. You will succeed if you are diligent about keeping up with the class schedule, and if you take advantage of opportunities to communicate with your instructor, as well as with your fellow students.</p>

<p>Specific learning objectives for each lesson and project are detailed within each lesson.</p>

<h3><a name="assignmentsandgrading"></a>Assignments and Grading</h3>

<p>This course will rely upon a variety of methods to assess and evaluate student learning:</p>

<table class="table-data" summary="The types of assignments and the percentage values for each">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Automated online quizzes (3 @ 50 points each)</th>
			<td>150 points</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Discussion participation (6 @ 25 points each)</th>
			<td>150 points</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Problem sets (4 @ 50 points each)</th>
			<td>200 points</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Unit projects (3 @ 100 points each)</th>
			<td>300 points</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">Final exam</th>
			<td>200 points</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row"><strong>TOTAL</strong></th>
			<td><strong>1,000 points</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Final overall grades will be determined based on averaged grades of these elements. So that you know where you stand, all grades will be posted in Canvas with each assignment. You will be able to track your progress and calculate your average as the course goes along.</p>

<p>Letter grades will be based on the following percentages:</p>

Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin, race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated (<a href="https://policy.psu.edu/policies/ad29">Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance</a> <span class="print-footnote">[18]</span>) and can be reported through Educational Equity via¬†<a href="http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/">Report Bias</a> <span class="print-footnote">[19]</span>.</p>

<h4>Counseling and Psychological Services</h4>

<p>Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing.¬† The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings.¬† These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients‚Äô cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity, and sexual orientation.¬† Services include the following:</p>

	Counseling Services at¬†<a href="http://senate.psu.edu/faculty/counseling-services-at-commonwealth-campuses/">Commonwealth Campuses</a> <span class="print-footnote">[21]</span><br />
	Penn State Crisis Line (24 hours/7 days/week): 877-229-6400<br />
	Crisis Text Line (24 hours/7 days/week): Text LIONS to 741741</p>

<h4>Military Personnel</h4>

<p>Veterans and currently serving military personnel and/or spouses with unique circumstances (e.g., upcoming deployments, drill/duty requirements, disabilities, VA appointments, etc.) are welcome and encouraged to communicate these, in advance if possible, to the instructor in the case that special arrangements need to be made.</p>

<h4>Connect Online with Caution</h4>

<p>Penn State is committed to educational access for all. Our students come from all walks of life and have diverse life experiences. As with any other online community, the lack of physical interaction in an online classroom can create a false sense of anonymity and security. While one can make new friends online, digital relationships can also be misleading. Good judgment and decision making are critical when choosing to disclose personal information to others whom you do not know.</p>
<h4>Deferred Grades</h4>

<p>If you are prevented from completing this course within the prescribed amount of time for reasons that are beyond your control, it is possible to have the grade deferred with the concurrence of the instructor, following <a href="http://senate.psu.edu/policies-and-rules-for-undergraduate-students/47-00-48-00-and-49-00-grades/#48-40">Penn State Deferred Grade Policy 48-40</a> <span class="print-footnote">[22]</span>. To seek a deferred grade, you must submit a written request (by e-mail or U.S. post) to the¬†instructor describing the reason(s) for the request. Non-emergency permission for filing a deferred grade must be requested before the beginning of the final examination period. ¬†It is up to the instructor to determine whether or not you will be permitted to receive a deferred grade. If permission is granted, you will work with the instructor to establish a communication plan and a clear schedule for completion within policy. ¬†If for any reason, the coursework for the deferred grade is not complete by the assigned time, a grade of "F" will be automatically entered on your transcript.</p>
<div id="attendance">
	<h4>Attendance</h4>

	<p>This course will be conducted entirely online. There will be no set class meeting times, but you will be required to complete weekly assignments with specific due dates. Many of the assignments are open for multiple days, so it is your responsibility to complete the work early if you plan to travel or participate in national holidays, religious observances or University approved activities.</p>

	<p>If you need to request an exception due to a personal or medical emergency, contact the instructor directly as soon as you are able. Such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
</div>
<h4>Diversity, Inclusion, and Respect</h4>

<p>Penn State is ‚Äúcommitted to creating an educational environment which is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups and strives to create and maintain an environment that fosters respect for others‚Äù as stated in Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment and to interact with civility.</p>
