<p>It is reasonable to conclude, from our previous examination of projected climate change impacts, that some sort of coordinated response is warranted. One potential response involves <em>adaptation</em> — changing our behavior in such a way as to mitigate the impacts of climate change on our lives and livelihood. In fact, given that there is likely substantial additional climate change already in the pipeline, and we are committed to some degree of additional changes in climate regardless of what measures are taken to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, we will have to adapt to some changes that are in store. In this lesson, we will examine what the key vulnerabilities are, and what adaptive measures might be taken to guard against them.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Adaptation vs. Mitigation</h1>
  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><div class="tex2jax"><p>The challenge of confronting the impacts of climate change is often framed in terms of two potential paths that civilization might take: <em>adaptation</em> and <em>mitigation</em>. Mitigation involves reducing the magnitude of climate change itself and, as we will see in the final two lessons, can be subdivided into two alternative strategies: <em>emissions reductions <em>—</em> </em>dealing with the problem at its very source, and <em>geoengineering</em> — somehow offsetting the effects of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Adaptation, by contrast, involves efforts to limit <em>our</em> vulnerability to climate change impacts through various measures, while not necessarily dealing with the underlying cause of those impacts. The reference to "our" in the previous sentence is critical, as adaptive measures typically only deal with impacts to human civilization; they do not and, indeed, cannot deal with impacts to ecosystems and our environment. <a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo469/node/166">Coral reefs</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span>, for example, are unlikely to adapt to the twin impacts of global warming and ocean acidification. A similar case can be made for other ecosystems and living things. At some level, such considerations call into question what we really mean by adaptation. If we were to see the collapse of major ecosystems such as coral reefs, we would in turn see the loss of the <em>ecosystem services</em> they provide — a potentially catastrophic loss for human civilization. We will consider such potential costs when we attempt to work out the <em>economics of climate change</em> in a later lesson.</p>

<p>Such considerations call into question whether we can indeed define our true adaptive capacity to climate change in a way that is divorced from the larger impacts on our environment. Nonetheless, let us for the moment consider adaptation and mitigation as two alternative but potentially complementary and certainly <em>not </em>mutually exclusive strategies for dealing with climate change.</p>

</div>

<p>The choice between adaptation and mitigation is in fact, in many ways, a false choice — we will most likely have to do both. As we have seen previously in this course, we are already committed to additional warming of perhaps as much as 1°C due to the greenhouse gases that we have emitted already — this is known as <em>committed climate change</em>. Aside from the possibility of controversial geoengineering measures (which we will discuss in our next lesson), we cannot mitigate that change. So, we must adapt to at least that amount of climate change.</p>

<p>A useful way to look at the level of vulnerability to climate change is considering scenarios that involve no response measures at all (i.e., no adaptation or mitigation), adaptation alone, mitigation alone, and a combination of adaptation and mitigation.</p>

<p>As is apparent from the above comparisons, much of the world would likely suffer extreme vulnerability to climate change in the absence of any mitigation efforts at all, regardless of what adaptive measures are taken. Yet, mitigation alone, for example limiting CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations to 550 ppm, would in the absence of any adaptive measures still result in great vulnerability, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. However, a combination of adaptation and mitigation could reduce vulnerability to modest levels for most of the world.</p>

<p>We will talk about mitigation approaches in the final two lessons. For the rest of this lesson, we will examine adaptive strategies. We will focus on specific examples in the areas of coastal protection, water resources, and agriculture/food resources.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Adaptive Strategies - Sea Level Rise</h1>
  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><div class="tex2jax"><p>There are various potential measures we might consider taking in defending our coastlines against the threat of sea level rise. We might think of them as sequential steps that can be taken as rising sea level continues to encroach on coastal settlements. We are likely already committed to at least 0.3 m (i.e., roughly 1 foot) of global sea level rise, enough, as we've seen previously, to threaten increased coastal erosion along the east and gulf coast of the U.S., and to submerge low-lying island regions.</p>

<div class="img-center"><img alt="Rising Water pictures showing protection through engineering, accommodating inudation, and coastal retreat." class="mceItem" src="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo469/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo469/files/lesson10/AdaptSLRDP.jpg">

</div>

<p>The first step is to actively confront encroaching seas by building structures such as polders, which reclaim inundated coastal regions, and coastal defenses such as dikes, beach nourishments, etc., which provide an impediment to rising waters. When that is no longer adequate, one might move on to the next step — accommodating some degree of inundation. That might include building flood-proof structures, and floating platforms for agriculture, etc. The final step is retreat. It can involve managed retreating, such as the building of sea walls, and planned evacuation when no other options are available. The island nation of Tuvalu, threatened with imminent impacts from sea level rise, for example, has already arranged for retreat to New Zealand when necessary.</p>

<p>Let us perform a thought experiment. Recall the projected sea level rise for the next two centuries (see figure below). Let us consider the gray region to represent the region of 95% confidence. Suppose you are an owner of a coastal property in a location where sea level rise is predicted to follow the projected global mean rise. Suppose that at 0.3 m sea level rise you can expect significant erosion of your beach front, at 0.5 m of sea level rise you can expect regular flooding of your property from coastal storms, and at 1 m of sea level rise you can expect the front stairs to your house to be below sea level.</p>

	<h4>Think About It!</h4>

		Click to reveal an answer.</p>

	<div class="clicktip" id="ctdef">This is an open-ended question, with no one right answer.<br>
		<br>
		One reasonable response would be that at 0.3 m some engineering solution, such as beach nourishment, might be viable, while at 0.5 m some degree of accommodation (e.g., using stilts to raise the house above the beach) might be possible, and at 1 m retreat, i.e.,requesting some sort of bail out from FEMA, might be your only recourse.<br>
		<br>
		As for the timeline of response, that would depend on how risk averse you are. If you were to err on the highly cautious side, you might be guided by the upper end of the range of projected sea level rise, which gives 0.3 m at about 2050, 0.5 m at about 2070, and 1 m around 2080. That means you would be planning on minor engineering measures in less than 4 decades, while your children who inherit the property would be engaged in major engineering measures in less than 6 decades, and then bailing out by the turn of the century.<br>

</div>

<p>What, if any, measures could we take to adapt to these changes? Possible adaptations can, in fact, be found on both the supply side and the demand side.</p>

<p>Let us first consider some supply-side options. Freshwater could, for example, be transported from regions that are likely to see more precipitation to those likely to see less. The required transport (which costs both money and energy!) could be minimized by exploiting the fact that in many cases such regions are reasonably near to each other, e.g., tropical Africa (more runoff)&nbsp; vs. South Africa (less runoff), or the Pacific Northwest (more runoff) vs. desert southwest (less runoff) of U.S., or Northern Europe (more runoff) vs. southern Europe and Mediterranean (less runoff). Other possibilities involve greater exploitation of groundwater sources, though this faces the challenge of over-tapped aquifers, which is already a problem in the U.S.&nbsp; Desalinization makes sense, particularly for coastal regions of the U.S., Australia, and the Mediterranean which are predicted to dry, and where a nearby saltwater source would help minimize transportation costs. Desalinization is currently highly expensive and extremely energy intensive, making it a prohibitive source of freshwater today. However, as water resources diminish and technology improves, it is possible that desalinization will become a more viable option in the future. See table below for other possible supply-side solutions.</p>

<p>What about the demand side? More efficient recycling of water and better conservation of water resources is an obvious approach. Both constitute what is often referred to as <em>no regrets</em> approaches — a concept we will encounter later in the context of climate change mitigation. Such actions not only cost us nothing, but they could, in fact, provide benefits, e.g., lower household water bills! Similarly, more efficient means of irrigation of crops could save water and provide other benefits as well.</p>

<p>Another possibility is the idea of tradable water access rights. This too has an analogy with climate change mitigation, since one approach that has been suggested for reducing carbon emissions is to allow individual companies limited numbers of permits for emitting and then letting them trade and sell them. The same thing could be done for rights to water resources. The idea behind this is that the efficiencies of the free market will, at least in principle, find the most cost effective means of meeting water resource needs, since those with excess fresh water would be motivated to sell their valuable water rights to others willing to pay a premium for them.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Adaptive Strategies - Agricultural Practices</h1>
  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><div class="tex2jax"><p>We examined likely impacts on agricultural productivity (and livestock) in our <a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo469/node/168">previous discussion</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span> of climate change impacts. While on balance these impacts are projected to be negative (particularly in the tropics), there are adaptive measures that can be taken to mitigate the losses in agricultural productivity.</p>

<p>Possible agricultural adaptations include changing crop locations; for example, seeking out higher elevation environments and cooler micro-climates. Adaptations also include changing crop rotation patterns and tilling methods; for example, so-called <em>no-till </em>agriculture keeps sub-surface soils cooler and wetter, which might mitigate the effects of warmer and dryer conditions. One can switch to crop varieties (or <em>cultivars)</em> that are better adapted to the changing weather patterns and climate or amend planting schedules to adapt to shifting seasonal temperature and rainfall patterns. And perhaps as the final line of retreat in the adaptation process, one can change the choice of crops grown, for example, replacing wheat with sorghum as conditions become increasingly arid.</p>

<p>Let us consider the potential mitigation of losses (or maybe even gains) that might come from employing these agricultural adaptations. Let us make the simplifying, if perhaps overly optimistic, assumption of <em>optimal </em>adaptation. That is to say, let us assume that stakeholders operate with perfect information and take the most favorable possible adaptive measures in response to changing climate conditions. Under that assumption, things do not appear too bad, at least for moderate future warming.</p>

<p>Let us consider the predictions for varying levels of future warming and associated CO<sub>2</sub> increase (note that there is a direct impact of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization in addition to the indirect climate change impacts from increasing CO<sub>2</sub>). For 1-2°C warming, we can expect to see increased yields across crops in the extra-tropics, due, in large part, to longer growing seasons, and, with appropriate adaptations, the agricultural productivity could be enhanced even more, approaching 10% for rice and corn and 20% for wheat. For that same amount of warming in the tropics, however, cereal crop productivity either remains the same (rice) or declines (wheat and corn). However, appropriate adaptations can change the picture, turning declines into modest gains. On the global scale for the modest 1-2°C warming, agricultural productivity increases, largely due to the gains in the extra-tropics. However, even at this moderate level of warming, we begin to see the challenges of the regional asymmetry in agricultural productivity responses — the gains are primarily in the regions that are already able to meet food requirements (i.e., the developed world of the extra-tropics), and not in the regions faced by shortfalls owing to their lesser wealth and growing population (i.e., the developing world of the tropics). As warming increases beyond 3°C, this disparity becomes even greater, as low-latitude regions are likely to see agricultural productivity declines regardless of what adaptive measures are taken. For warming beyond 3°C, global agricultural yields decline even with adaptation, and global food prices show substantial increases. As warming approaches 5°C, losses are seen in the extra-tropics as well as in the tropical regions, regardless of the adaptive measures, and global agricultural productivity losses and food price increases become substantial.</p>

<p>Now, you will investigate these relationships in detail yourself, interactively, using a more elaborate version of the agriculture application you encountered in our previous lesson. The application now indicates changes in yields of major cereal crops (wheat, rice, and corn) both <em>with</em> and <em>without </em>adaptive measures. Please take some time to explore the agricultural application below. You will be using this tool in Project 2, which begins this week.</p>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Lesson 10 Summary</h1>
  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><div class="tex2jax"><p>In this lesson, we looked at the potential impacts of projected climate change on civilization and our environment. The key points are as follows.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Adaptation and mitigation are two often-discussed strategies for dealing with the threats and challenges of human-caused climate change. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive —it is very likely that both will need to be employed if we are to limit societal vulnerability to climate change.</li>
	<li>Adaptive measures to reduce coastal vulnerability to sea level rise take the form of three progressively more defensive responses to increasing magnitudes of sea level rise — protection through engineering, followed by accommodation to rising sea level and, eventually, managed retreat.</li>
	<li>There are a variety of adaptive responses that might be taken to deal with shifting water resources resulting from anthropogenic climate change. These responses take the form of <em>demand side</em> and <em>supply side </em>actions. On the demand side are better conservation of available freshwater resources (a so-called <em>no regrets</em> strategy), and introduction of a system of tradable water rights to help insure efficient use of available fresh water. On the supply side are the development of better distribution systems to move water from regions of surplus to regions of deficit, better use of available groundwater and freshwater aquifers, and (though currently not cost effective) the use of desalinization technology, particularly in coastal regions where distribution requirements would be minimized.</li>
	<li>Adaptation can to some extent mitigate the loss of agricultural productivity due to climate change, though there are substantial differences between tropical and extra-tropical regions, and also between different crops (e.g., staple cereal crops such as rice, wheat, and corn/maize).</li>
	<li>Theoretical crop models subject to admittedly limited (and perhaps not wholly realistic) climate change scenarios of, e.g., simple warming of temperatures and elevation of CO<sub>2</sub> levels, indicate that for moderate warming, losses in tropical regions can be mitigated through the introduction of appropriate adaptive measures. Adaptive measures can further bolster agricultural increases in extratropical regions that benefit from longer-growing seasons with warming.</li>
	<li>The same crop models indicate that as the warming progresses, gains in the extra-tropical regions become increasingly less, and losses in the tropical regions become increasingly greater, even with appropriate adaptive measures. As warming approaches 5 °C, losses are seen in all regions regardless of adaptation, and both global food productivity declines and global food price increases become substantial.</li>

<p>Please realize that a discussion is a group effort and make sure to participate early in order to give your classmates enough time to respond to your posts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Post your comments addressing some aspect of the material that is of interest to you and respond to other postings by asking for clarification, asking a follow-up question, expanding on what has already been said, etc. For each new topic you are posting, please try to start a new discussion thread with a descriptive title, in order to make the conversation easier to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Suggested topics</h4>

<p>The purpose of the discussion is to facilitate a free exchange of thoughts and opinions among the students, and you are encouraged to discuss any topic within the general discussion theme that is of interest to you.&nbsp; If you find it helpful, you may also use the topics suggested below.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>"An Inconvenient Truth"</p>

<ul>
	<li>Did you notice any inaccuracies in Al Gore's presentation of the science and/or impacts of climate change?&nbsp; Compare / contrast his perspective with the perspective today.</li>
	<li>Did you find the comparison with tobacco industry effective?</li>
	<li>According to Al Gore, how much disagreement is there the scientific community on the issue of global warming? Did you find his argument compelling?</li>

  <h1 class="book-heading">Project #2:  Crop Models</h1>
  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><div class="tex2jax"><p>We have seen over the past two lessons that agriculture is one key area of societal vulnerability to future climate change, but the challenges are complicated to confront. The effects are likely to be differentially felt in various parts of the globe, with the tropical regions more likely suffering losses, and extra-tropical regions seeing gains, at least for moderate levels of warming and atmospheric CO<sub style="font-weight: normal;">2</sub> enrichment. Adaptive measures can ameliorate losses and potentially even turn losses into gains. Thus, any solution will likely require some degree of mitigation and some degree of adaptation. Moreover, the regionally-disaggregated nature of impacts will require policies that allow for an equitable redistribution of food resources from regions that are likely to see gains to regions that are likely to see losses.</p>

<p>In this project, you will propose your own policy solution to deal with agricultural vulnerability to future climate change. You will make use of quantitative tools that we have introduced in this course to address climate change mitigation, assess agricultural impacts, and modify those impacts through adaptation.</p>

	<h4>Note</h4>

	<p>For this assignment, you will need to record your work on a word processing document. Your work must be submitted in Word (.doc or .docx), or PDF (.pdf) format so the instructor can open it.</p>
</div>

<p>In this project, you are in charge of drafting an international protocol for maintaining global food security in the face of projected climate change over the next century, through a combination of (1) climate change mitigation, (2) agricultural adaptation, (3) policies for redistributing food resources to where they are needed, and crop substitution.</p>

<p>You will find it useful to employ two applications we have used in this course thus far:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong><a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo469/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo469/files/lesson03/0d_EBM.html">Online 0d EBM Application</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span></strong><br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong><a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo469/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo469/files/lesson10/epic_sim.swf">Agricultural Impacts/Adaptation Application</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span></strong></li>
</ol>

<p>As you proceed to design your policy, please use the following assumptions and rules:</p>

<h4><span><span>Assumptions:</span></span></h4>

<ol>
	<li><em>Current yields</em> are defined at 0°C warming and correspond to <em>no net deficit or surplus</em>. In the Agricultural application, current yields are graphically depicted as 4 units (bushels) of agricultural yield, so that, for example, a 25% increase in yields would be depicted as an increase to 5 units.</li>
	<li>Increased food demand due to projected population growth is partially offset by improvements in agricultural technology, more widespread allocation of land for agricultural use, and economies of scale. Thus, despite a projected increase in global population of over 70% during the next century, assume that you will be able to meet projected food demands if you achieve a 4% increase in agricultural productivity relative to the current yields. [This is a highly optimistic assumption].</li>
	<li>Assume that food needs (i.e., the projected 4% increase relative to the current yields) are similar in both the tropical and extra-tropical sub-regions. In reality, this is not exactly true, as developing nations that are currently unable to meet existing food requirements are predominantly found in the tropics.</li>
	<li>Assume that each crop contributes equally to the total production in each sub-region and also that the tropics and the extra-tropics contribute equally to the total world production. This means that, for example, if you increase the tropical wheat production by 6%, this would cause the overall production in the tropical sub-region to increase by 6% * 1/3 = 2% and the total world production to increase by 2% * 1/2 = 1%.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Assume a mid-range climate sensitivity in establishing the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> concentration stabilization levels and global mean warming.</li>
	<li>In the Agricultural application, <em>current global mean temperatures</em> are defined as 0.8°C higher than the pre-industrial mean temperatures. You need to account for that when using the EBM application,&nbsp; which measures net warming relative to<em> </em>the pre-industrial temperatures (at 280 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations).&nbsp; That is, you need to subtract 0.8° from the warming calculated by the EBM application for a given CO<sub>2</sub> level.</li>
	<li>Because of the <a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo469/node/150">projected amplification</a> <span class="print-footnote">[12]</span> of warming over the continental regions, we will make a conservative assumption that all land regions warm 25% more than the global mean. That is, for a given CO<sub>2</sub> level, you need to increase the projected warming (after making 0.8°C correction) by 25%.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h4>Rules:</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Your default scenario is business-as-usual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which we will represent by stabilization of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> at 700 ppm, and a capacity to fund adaptation efforts for each crop in each region. [Reminder: to set&nbsp; CO<sub>2</sub> values <em>above </em>550 ppm in the EBM application, you need to enter the desired stabilization level manually directly underneath the slider].</li>
	<li>As a policymaker confronted with the real world constraints, you face a trade-off in the resources available to fund mitigation and adaptation efforts. That is, for every 50 ppm units you attempt to lower the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions below business-as-usual levels (700 ppm), you lose the ability to fund <em>one</em> adaptation effort, i.e., to employ adaptations for one crop in either the tropics or extra-tropics. Note that this set-up provides a floor of 400 ppm stabilization, since there are only 3 crops x 2 sub-regions = 6 total possible adaptation efforts. So, effectively, you are allowed a total of six (adaptation / 50-ppm mitigation) efforts.</li>
	<li>You can substitute up to one crop for another within each sub-region, the tropics and the extra-tropics, at no cost in terms of adaptation / mitigation efforts. For example, if corn yields show less decline than wheat yields in the tropics for a given climate scenario, you may substitute corn for wheat in meeting tropical food requirements.&nbsp; The crop being used to substitute for another may be adapted first, at the normal cost of one adaptation / mitigation effort.</li>
	<li>You are allowed to transfer yields (including adapted yields)from one sub-region to the other but at a cost in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: for each half unit of agricultural productivity to be transferred, the CO<sub>2</sub> stabilization level is increased by additional 50 ppm.&nbsp; Thus, for example, you may theoretically use six adaptation efforts for each crop / subregion combination and transfer a half unit of excess yield from one subregion to the other, but without any mitigation efforts your CO<sub>2</sub> stabilization concentration would be 750 ppm.&nbsp; Note also that if you had computed your yields for 700 ppm but then rely on subregional transfer, you would have to recompute your yields to be valid at 750 ppm -- unless you also apply resources towards one 50-ppm mitigation effort, to bring CO2 back down to 700 ppm.</li>
	<li>In your final answer, global yields, <em>as well as yields in each sub-region</em>, must have increased by 4%.&nbsp; If you find multiple scenarios that satisfy all the rules, discuss which of the scenarios you as a policy maker would prefer to implement.</li>
