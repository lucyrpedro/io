  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Before we begin our semester of study together, it is important that you review all of the material located in the <em>Course Orientation</em> module in Canvas (located on the "Modules" page), as it will not only prepare you to be successful in this course, but it will also help you prepare for the "Course Information" quiz at the end of the orientation. You must get a score of at least 90% on that quiz to gain access to Lesson 1 ...and the answers are all contained in this orientation!</p>

<div class="box-note">
	<p><strong>Have you looked at the course syllabus?</strong> This course orientation will complement and expand on the information provided on our syllabus. Be sure to review that document, too...carefully! You can find the syllabus by clicking on the "Syllabus" link in Canvas.</p>
</div>

<h3>What will we learn about in the Course Orientation?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The structure of <em>METEO</em> 3</li>
	<li>What assignments are required in this course</li>
	<li>An overview of Canvas, Penn State's course management system</li>
	<li>Technical requirements for <em>METEO</em> 3</li>
	<li>How to succeed in this course</li>
	<li>Where to get course assistance if you need it</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is due for the Course Orientation?</h3>

<p>You should complete the Course Orientation in the first few days after the course begins. (See the syllabus for specific due dates.)</p>

<p>As you work your way through these online materials for the Course Orientation, you will encounter additional reading assignments and hands-on exercises and activities. The chart below provides an overview of the requirements for the Course Orientation. For assignment details, refer to the orientation page noted.<br>

<h3>Questions?</h3>

<p>If you have any questions, please post them to the appropriate<em> "Classroom" </em>discussion (not e-mail), located under the corresponding module in Canvas. I will check that discussion daily to respond. While you are there, feel free to post your own responses if you, too, are able to help out a classmate.</p>

<h3>Keep reading!</h3>

<p>On the following pages, you will find important information about the course structure, requirements, scheduling, and technical requirements and assistance...all of which you'll need to know in order to pass the course. Remember, you are also responsible for the information located on our course syllabus.</p>
</div></div></div>  <div id="node-2228" class="section-3">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Navigating METEO 3</h1>
  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><div class="box-motivate">
	<h3 class="header-motivate">Motivate...</h3>

	<p>In developing the online lessons for this course, I wanted you to be able to focus in on the key concepts and skills that are absolutely vital for meeting the course goals, so I devised a&nbsp;classification scheme to help you easily understand how each piece of material fits into "what you need to know." The key to efficient and effective learning is, therefore, to be able to identify each type of information presented in the course, which my classification boxes will help with.</p>

	<p>You will notice that throughout the course, all lesson content is placed in containers (boxes like this one). The titles of these containers give you a clue&nbsp;to the purpose of the information they contain. For example, in the "Motivate..." containers, I give you a "big picture" look at a particular topic. The reason that I do this is to convince you that what you are about to learn is an important component of the overall goal in this course. As you are going through the week's material, you should think about this "big picture" and how what you are learning will "fit together" with the other concepts that you have learned.&nbsp; Studies have shown that by knowing how bits of knowledge fit together, students actually are able to learn and retain information better. Will what's presented in the "Motivate..." box be on an exam? No... but it's important nonetheless.</p>

	<p>Read down through the rest of the boxes below and familiarize yourself with other types of information in this course.</p>
</div>

<div class="box-prioritize">
	<h3 class="header-prioritize">Prioritize...</h3>

	<p>Each content page contains a "Prioritize... " box, located at the top. These boxes describe the most important concepts and skills presented in each section. In educational terms, "Prioritize..." boxes contain the <em>learning objectives</em> for that page. Taken as a whole, they comprise the topics and skills on which you will be assessed at the end of each lesson on lab exercises and quizzes. You should always make note of this information both <strong>before and after</strong> reading the lesson material. As you study the material, ask yourself, "Can I&nbsp; perform the tasks that these learning objectives are asking of me?" If your answer is no (or maybe), then it's time to re-read the page or (even better) ask some specific questions of your instructor or classmates.</p>
</div>

<div class="box-read">
	<h3 class="header-read">Read...</h3>

	<p>The "Read..." section contains the main bulk of the course content. You should, of course, <em>read</em> the information contained in this box. You are responsible for understanding all of the concepts, skills, and examples provided in the "Read..." container. The "Read..." sections constitute your main reading assignment for the week. Any material covered in the "Read..." section may find its way into an assessment.</p>
</div>

<div class="box-keyskill">
	<h3 class="header-keyskill">Key Skill...</h3>

	<p>If you see a "Key Skill..." container on a page, pay particularly close attention to what it says. Key skills are just that -- skills that you <strong><em>must</em></strong> master in order to do well in the course. Key skills are often critical building blocks which are necessary to understand more advanced concepts. I can say with confidence that not only will you see key skills on an assessment, you will see them on many assessments. Do not move on from a given lesson without having absolute confidence that you can perform a key skill.</p>
</div>

<div class="box-quizyourself">
	<h3 class="header-quizyourself">Quiz Yourself...</h3>

	<p>Need to practice your "Key Skill..."? This is what the "Quiz Yourself..."&nbsp; box is for. It contains a self-quiz that will test your understanding of a key skill emphasized on the page. These quizzes are meant both as self-checks as well as additional learning opportunities. They do not count for a grade (they don't even keep a record) and you can use them as often as you wish. Let me give you some advice... if you are finding a particular self-quiz difficult, this is a definite warning sign that you should spend more time wrestling with that particular key skill. In addition, I also suggest that you seek out help to diagnose where you are going wrong. If you do not do so, you will most likely encounter the same difficulties on an assessment that <em>will</em> count towards your overall grade. Better to figure it out sooner than later.</p>

	<div class="image-left-35"><img alt="Photograph of Steve Seman" img="" src="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/images/lesson0/steveS_mini1.jpg"></div>

	<p>I'm Steve Seman, a faculty member in the Department of Meteorology and a fellow of the Dutton Institute for e-Education, housed in Penn State's College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. I will be your instructor this semester. I will be online most days during the semester (business hours during the week and sporadically during the weekend) and will be happy to answer any questions that you might have. I look forward to getting to know you online! If you would like to learn a bit more about me and my interests, check out my bio, below.</p>

	<p>Many meteorologists know that they want to study the atmosphere from a very early age, and so it was with me. I remember finding an old cloud chart around age 5, and I was hooked. When traveling, I would always stare skyward out the car window to see if I could figure out what kinds of clouds were in the sky, and whenever the sky darkened due to an <a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/images/lesson0/cloud0007_0.jpg" target="_blank">imminent thunderstorm</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span>, I was filled with both terror and wonder.</p>

	<p>After growing up in Findlay, Ohio, I decided to study meteorology at Penn State, and earned my B.S. in 2003. Since then, I've written forecasts for the <em>New York Times</em>, and have occasionally produced and appeared on <a href="http://weatherworld.psu.edu/" target="_blank"><em>Weather World</em></a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span> (which airs Monday through Friday on the Pennsylvania Cable Network (PCN) and WPSU PBS). My experience with online education goes back to my senior year of college, when I acted as a student assistant for the Meteorology Department's first ever online course, and I've been involved in online education ever since. It's been fascinating to watch the growth and evolution of online learning, and in 2009, I earned an M. Ed. in Adult Education from Penn State. My areas of academic interest are weather forecasting (especially severe weather), weather communications, and effective and efficient methods of facilitating discussions in online learning environments.</p>

	<p>When not checking out the weather, I enjoy spending time with my wife and children, as well as other family members and friends. I'm a big music-lover as well. My favorite band is "Chicago," and most of my other favorite music comes from the 1970s. I'm also an avid fan of Cincinnati Reds baseball and Penn State football, and I even try to play golf now and then.</p>

	<p>I'm eager to work with everyone and I hope you enjoy the course! I am dedicated to putting forth as much effort as I can to help students learn, and I hope it shines through.</p>

	<h3>Philip Lutzak, Teaching Assistant</h3>

	<div class="image-left-35"><img alt="Photograph of Phil Lutzak" src="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/images/lesson0/ta_1.jpg"></div>

	<p><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 204);">Phil's primary responsibility in this course is to grade the weekly Lab Exercises. If you have questions about a grade on one of the assignments, please send him a Canvas email (as per our communication policy, please post general questions about any given assignment in the appropriate "Classroom" discussion). To learn more about Phil, check out his bio below...</span></p>

	<p>Hello from Phil Lutzak. I live in Brooklyn, New York. I’ve been fascinated with weather since I was very young. My original neighborhood in Queens, New York (near JFK airport) was heavily damaged by Hurricane Donna when I was young. This storm caused a lot of structural damage, destroying houses, snapping large trees in half and downing power lines &amp; street signs everywhere. Being very young, I was amazed that a storm could do this kind of damage in a place that doesn't see many hurricanes. It impressed me so strongly that I started reading any book that I could find about hurricanes, and eventually I sought out more books to understand the meteorology that these hurricane books covered. Ever since, my fascination for anything weather-related, and my desire to understand it, has just continued to grow.</p>

	<p>I graduated from Penn State's Weather Forecasting Program in May 2007. The highlights of my course work are available on <a href="http://www.philip-lutzak.com/weather/" target="_blank">philip-lutzak.com</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span>, as well as other projects I've taken on to improve my knowledge of the atmosphere.</p>
</div>
</div></div></div>  </div>
<div id="node-2080" class="section-3">
  <h1 class="book-heading">Course Assignments</h1>
  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><div class="box-prioritize">
	<h3 class="header-prioritize">Prioritize...</h3>

	<p>One of the first keys to doing well in this course is to understand the assessment structure. By the end of this section you should be able to describe the various components of your final grade and the percentage that each component is weighted. Make sure that you understand the policies relating to dropped grades and which types of assessment have no make ups. Finally, make sure that you understand what you should do if "life circumstances" will challenge your course progress, and what I consider academic dishonesty (and its resulting consequences).</p>
</div>

<div class="box-read">
	<h3 class="header-read">Read...</h3>

	<p>Your grade in <em>METEO 3</em> will be determined by your performance on the following components:</p>

	<h3>"Taking Your Temperature" Surveys: 5% of final grade</h3>

	<p>Each lesson contains a short (3-5 question) "Taking Your Temperature" survey, with questions designed for me to better understand your perspectives and opinions on topics relating to the corresponding lesson material. <strong>Each survey should only take you a few minutes to complete and</strong> <strong>should be completed before you begin the corresponding lesson. Therefore, the survey needs to be submitted several days before the lesson's quiz / lab deadline</strong> (see the syllabus in Canvas for specific deadlines). You will receive full credit for each survey as long as you complete all of the questions and submit it before the deadline. Questions will not be graded as right or wrong since I am gauging your perspectives and opinions (and not your level of knowledge), so please answer all questions as honestly as you can. As long as you complete and submit the surveys before their respective deadlines, you will earn full credit toward this portion of your grade.</p>

	<div class="box-note">
		<p><em><strong><font color="#ff0000">Very important note:</font> </strong></em> Because "Taking Your Temperature" surveys will automatically close when their deadlines pass, there is no opportunity to make up missed surveys (<strong>regardless of the reason... no exceptions</strong>). <span>Because of this strict rule, I will drop two surveys over the course of the semester, so, if you essentially get two "free passes" on surveys without a negative impact on your grade.</span></p>
	</div>

	<h3>Lesson Quizzes: 30% of final grade</h3>

	<p>At the end of each lesson, you'll be required to take a Lesson Quiz that covers key concepts from the assigned readings, as well as the online lesson material. Each Lesson Quiz is timed, and you will have one chance to complete it. Lesson Quizzes are open book / note, but given the time limits provided, you won't be able to extensively search through your materials.</p>

	<p>Each Lesson Quiz will open at the same time that its respective lesson opens, and they'll close at the lesson deadline (typically Friday night at 11:59 pm ET). Because submitting quizzes relies on technology, I recommend strongly that you don't wait until the last minute to submit your quizzes. That way, if a technical problem arises, we'll have time to resolve it before the deadline passes and the quiz disappears. Please note that quizzes are programmed to "auto-submit" when the allocated time is up. For example, if it's a 30-minute quiz, the quiz will auto-submit your answers 30 minutes after you started it (if you have not already completed it and submitted your answers yourself).</p>

	<p>After you submit your Lesson Quiz, you will receive a feedback report containing the correct answers and explanations. These explanations are designed to help reinforce key concepts from the lesson, and will likely be helpful in studying for the final exam.</p>

	<div class="box-note">
		<p><em><strong><font color="#ff0000">Very important note:</font> </strong></em> Because Lesson Quizzes will automatically close when their deadlines pass, there is no opportunity to make up missed quizzes (<strong>regardless of the reason... no exceptions</strong>). &nbsp;<span>Because of this strict rule, I will drop your two lowest quiz scores over the course of the semester, so, if you happen to miss a quiz (or perform very poorly on one), it won't negatively impacting your grade.</span></p>
	</div>

	<h3>Lab Exercises: 40% of final grade</h3>

	<p>Each lesson also contains its own Lab Exercise (located in the Lesson module), which will generally be due at the same time as the Lesson Quiz. Each exercise includes its own set of instructions for either collecting some weather data using the Web and analyzing it, or analyzing some past data provided in the assignment. Each lab must be submitted by the deadline. Late labs will not be accepted unless you've made a <strong>prior agreement</strong> (before the deadline) with the course instructor.</p>

	<p>In the event that you must miss a lab deadline (I understand that "life" happens sometimes--illness, sick family members, unexpected travels, etc.),<strong> you must make arrangements with me well before the lab deadline in order to receive an extension. </strong>I can be flexible to a degree when students are proactive in keeping me informed of their circumstances and special needs for lab-deadline extensions. However, at the last minute before a deadline passes, or after a deadline passes, I won't be as flexible. Finally, as with Lesson Quizzes, I will drop your lowest two lab scores over the course of the semester.</p>

	<h3>Final Exam: 25% of final grade</h3>

	<p>The final exam will be available on the dates specified on the syllabus (details will be announced several weeks before the end of the course). During this period, you will have 2 hours of your own choosing to complete the final. The exam will be much like the quizzes, only longer and more comprehensive. Also, like the quizzes, questions will be selected from a database ensuring that all students receive exams of equal difficulty and subject-matter, but with different questions in different order.</p>

	<p>The best way to do well on the final exam is to keep current with all the course material, study the feedback you receive to quizzes and labs, and ask questions when you need to throughout the semester.</p>

	<div class="box-note">
		<p><em><strong><font color="#ff0000">Very important note:</font> </strong></em>During the time period that the final exam is open (see the dates on the Modules page in Canvas), plan to be in a location that has a <em>reliable</em> internet connection. The final exam <em><strong>must </strong></em>be taken at some point during this period and submitted by the deadline on the syllabus.&nbsp;It <strong>cannot</strong> be taken on any other days, regardless of reason.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Extra Credit</h3>

	<p>I've had some students in the past who have not adequately engaged their online courses, and subsequently struggled. They'll frequently ask for "extra credit" as the semester comes to a close in order to make up for previous missed assignments or poor performances. My philosophy is that such "extra credit" would really not be "extra" at all. It would be merely a replacement, or a substitute, for credit that was not earned the first time when everyone had opportunities to complete assignments or quizzes.</p>

	<p>Therefore, no extra credit assignments will be available in <em>METEO 3</em>. Several of the Lab Exercises, however, do offer specific opportunities to earn bonus points for providing additional, deeper, insights to specific questions (these available bonus points are clearly marked in the assignment instructions). Such bonus opportunities reward students who truly go "above and beyond the call" in showing a deep understanding of the material when prompted.</p>

	<h3>Grading Scale</h3>

	<p>Your performances on Lesson Quizzes, Lab Exercises, and the Final Exam will determine your final course grade.<span> <span>To track your grade throughout the semester, use the "Grades" link in Canvas, as well as the grading scale listed below. Note that the grading scale below is an approximation of where the final grade cut-offs will be, but depending on the performance of the class, final grades may be curved at the instructor's discretion.</span></span></p>

	<h3>Academic Dishonesty</h3>

	<p>It is unfortunate that I have to bring up this subject. I don't anticipate that academic dishonesty will be a big problem this semester, but it has been a few times in the past. Thus, I need to outline my policy very clearly so that your hard work is not cheapened by those who would choose an easier route.<br>
		<br>
		My policy is simply this: <strong>The work that you submit must be entirely your own work</strong>. Penn State defines academic integrity as "the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner." Academic integrity includes "a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception." In particular, the University defines plagiarism as "the fabrication of information and citations; submitting others' work from professional journals, books, articles, and papers; submission of other student's papers, lab results or project reports and representing the work as one's own." Penalties for violations of academic integrity may include forfeited assignments, course failure, or disqualification from a degree or certificate program. Feel free to read more on the <a href="https://www.ems.psu.edu/undergraduate/academic-advising/policies-procedures-and-forms/academic-integrity" target="_blank">academic integrity policy</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span> of Penn State's College of Earth and Mineral Sciences.</p>

	<p>In an online course environment, effective communication between you and me can have a dramatic impact on your overall experience. Therefore take time to read this section carefully.&nbsp; By the end of this section, you should be able to name the different methods that we have for communicating in this course and the appropriate uses for each. Furthermore, you should be able to discuss the appropriate etiquette required when communicating with me or your fellow classmates.</p>
</div>

<div class="box-read">
	<h3 class="header-read">Read...</h3>

	<p>Meaningful interactions among students and instructors are the hallmark of a successful online class, and being involved in clear and timely communication requires you to become familar with the tools available through Canvas. Canvas supports several types of communication, but we'll primarily use the e-mail tool (called "Conversations," and Canvas "Discussions." In addition, as a registered student, you have a Penn State e-mail account (&lt;Access Account ID&gt;@psu.edu) that you need to monitor for any official communications that come from the University or from the Penn State World Campus.</p>

	<p>Overall, written communication is critically important in online courses, since you will not be able to meet with your instructor and/or teaching assistant face-to-face, even if you are a student at University Park. Please keep in mind that students are taking <em>METEO 3</em> all over the world, and those students obviously have no easy way to visit us. Thus, to treat every student in exactly the same way, we have decided to only "meet" with our students online. In most cases, we believe that you will find our use of Canvas e-mail ("Conversations") and "discussions" sufficient for your questions. However, if during the course of the semester you would like to meet with your instructor in a one-on-one setting, we also have the ability to conduct "virtual" office-hours. To initiate such a meeting, simply e-mail your instructor to set-up an appointment.</p>

	<h3>"Discussions"</h3>

	<p>The <em>"Classroom"</em> discussions&nbsp; I've set up in each module are meant to be the primary means of communication between you, your classmates, and your instructor. Threaded discussions allow multiple posts and replies, and new posts appear in the Course Activity Stream page, so you will know when something has been posted.</p>

	<p>In general, questions and comments about lab assignments, quizzes, and lesson materials should be shared with the entire class via the corresponding discussion. That way, everyone can benefit from the interaction.</p>

	<p>To use a discussion in Canvas, follow the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-1913" target="_blank">instructions in the Canvas student user guide</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span>. Of course, with the many posts that will certainly occur during the semester, it's important to keep track of which posts you've read and which you haven't. The Canvas student user guide will <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-1926" target="_blank">help you keep track of what discussion posts you've read</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span>.</p>

	<h3>"Conversations"</h3>

	<p>Conversations are the equivalent of e-mail in Canvas. The tool is great to use for a quick e-mail to another student or instructor, although <strong>you should refrain from sending broadcast e-mails to the entire class</strong>. <strong>Please use course conversations only for private, personal messages to instructors (regarding grades, etc.) or fellow students</strong>. Think of it this way: If you have a personal issue that you would only voice in the professor's office (perhaps about grades, a personal family matter, etc.), then use conversations. Also, please be aware that I will <em>only answer e-mail sent through Canvas.</em> With as many as a hundred students (or more) regularly communicating with me in this course, along with teaching other online courses, I need to compartmentalize my e-mail communications so that I can respond in a timely manner.</p>

	<div class="box-note">
		<p><em><strong><font color="#ff0000">Very important note:</font> </strong></em> Remember that email (sent through Canvas) should only be used for questions of a private nature (like grades or other personal circumstances). Questions concerning course policy, procedures, or lesson materials should be posted in the appropriate <em>"Classroom</em>" discussion.</p>
	</div>

	<p>To use "Conversations" in Canvas, follow the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-2666" target="_blank">instructions in the Canvas student user guide</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span>.</p>

	<h3>General Etiquette</h3>

	<p>It's important to follow some general rules of etiquette for our written communications. These will probably seem like common sense to most of you, but based on past experience, sometimes such "sense" is not so "common." When communicating via discussion or e-mail ("conversations") be sure to:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Spell-check your notes. E-mail and discussion postings are written communication (not spoken). Therefore, they should contain correct grammar and punctuation (as well as correct spelling).</li>
		<li>Be courteous and respectful of everyone.</li>
		<li>Be careful how you express your thoughts and ideas. A poorly worded note can easily be misunderstood or misconstrued. Remember, recipients can't see your body language or the expression on your face. Nor can they hear the intonation in your voice. If you have a suspicion that something you wrote might be taken the wrong way, it probably will. So always proofread your note before hitting the "Send" button.</li>
		<li>You should never type strictly in "CAPS." Using "CAPS" is tantamount to shouting, and that's not a very courteous way to make a point.</li>
		<li>Never use vulgar or inappropriate language.</li>
		<li>Be constructive when you take issue with me or with a classmate's response. First point out the positives of his or her argument before offering why and how you disagree.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I look forward to interacting with all of you. Even if you usually "keep a low profile" in class, I'm hoping that you'll discover that our interactions online can be&nbsp;fun and rewarding!</p>

<p>Before you begin working through the course content, you need to make sure the computer you are using is configured properly for the multimedia that you will encounter. Below are specifications and tests to help make sure everything is in working order.</p>

<h3>Flash Movies and Animations</h3>

<p>We have Flash movies and animation material in many of the lessons in this course. Chances are pretty good that you already use a Web browser that is configured to play swf (Flash) files, but to be safe, below you'll find a "test" file that you should try out now to make sure you won't have problems later in the course. If this opens and runs smoothly for you, then you're ready to go. If you can't get the link below to play on your computer, then please refer to the steps at the bottom of this page to troubleshoot your problem.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><strong>Flash (.swf files):</strong></span><span> Check out this <a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/flash/hawaiiVR.swf" target="_blank">3-D model of the island of Hawaii </a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span> that you'll encounter in Lesson 1. If you open the link, and can see and manipulate 3-D Hawaii, you're all set with Flash!<strong> </strong></span></li>
</ul>

<h3><span>Having trouble? Troubleshooting tips...</span></h3>

<ul>
	<li><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> <em>Install a New Plugin.</em> If you are not able to play the files, start by installing (or re-installing) the Quicktime or Flash plug-ins. The links here will take you to the respective download sites (and their accompanying directions.) </span>

	<h3 class="header-prioritize">Prioritize...</h3>

	<p>When you've finished with this page, you should be able to follow the "Recipe for Success" in METEO 3. You should have reasonable expectations about how much time the course may require and the most effective way to tackle each lesson. In particular, note how to most effectively make use of the practice quizzes.</p>
</div>

<div class="box-read">
	<h3 class="header-read">Read...</h3>

	<p>I want everyone to succeed in <em>METEO</em> 3, but your success will primarily come down to your own personal expectations and approach to the course. To help you increase your chances of success, I've outlined a recipe that I encourage you to use as a guide in your approach to <em>METEO</em> 3.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>I'll go into more detail below, but in a nutshell, the recipe boils down to three things:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Spend sufficient time studying effectively, and <em>spread out</em> your study time during the week. Learning takes time, and cramming a whole lesson into a single marathon session (especially at the last minute) will likely not be successful. More details on what I mean by "studying effectively" are below.</li>
		<li>Take advantage of your opportunities to interact with classmates and your instructor (read and post questions in the<em> "Classroom" </em>discussions<em> </em>and read the insights provided by your instructor and classmates)</li>
		<li>Make effective use of the practice quizzes in each lesson. It's not as simple as just taking them a bunch of times for extra "practice." Details on a more effective and helpful approach are below.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I want to emphasize the point that<strong> the amount of quality time spent studying is critical</strong>. If you're expecting to race through each lesson and its assignments in a couple of hours (or less) just before the deadline, you're likely setting yourself up for disappointing results. In a three-credit course offered in a traditional classroom setting, students would attend class for three 50-minute lectures per week, and would also spend several hours studying and completing homework outside of class. You should expect this course to be no different.&nbsp;The university expects that a three-credit course will require about 8-10 hours per week.</p>

	<p>How should you approach each lesson? Your specific strategy will depend on your own personal learning style, but assuming that you're spending sufficient time engaged in lesson material and spreading out that time as suggested above, here's my suggested approach:</p>

	<h4>A Recipe For Success</h4>

	<ol>
		<li>Start early in the week by completing and submitting the lesson's "Taking Your Temperature" Survey (you may even want to do this immediately after completing the previous lesson)<em><strong>.</strong></em></li>
		<li>Complete the online reading assignment, and take time to explore the interactive tools, videos, and other links. I recommend that you break up the reading into manageable chunks (rather than all at once). Here are a few other suggestions when reading the material.
			<ul>
				<li>As you read, pay special attention the the "Prioritize" statements and <strong>take notes</strong> that will help you achieve the knowledge and or skills described by the "Prioritize" statements. Also, write down pertinent ideas or questions that you might have. You may find answers to these questions as you continue studying, or you can ask them in the lesson's <em>"Classroom</em>" discussion.</li>
				<li>If you encounter a confusing passage in the reading assignment, <strong>ask a question</strong> about it in the lesson's <em>"Classroom"</em> discussion. Talking about a difficult topic is so much better that struggling with it alone or trying to Google for a different explanation (which may bring you incorrect information). I monitor the discussions on a regular basis and enjoy answering your questions and helping you learn.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Even if you can't think of any specific questions to ask about the lesson material, take some time to check out each lesson's<em> "Classroom"</em> discussion to look for posts written by your instructor (especially for answers provided to questions posed by your classmates). You may find the additional commentary and question / answer exchanges to be helpful in clarifying certain topics or in formulating your own questions.</li>
		<li>Complete the lesson's lab assignment. Doing so before taking the quiz will help reinforce the material, as well as give you another indication of how well you have learned key concepts (if you have trouble working through the lab, you'll probably have trouble on the quiz). Completing the lab earlier in the week also will help avoid last-minute technical problems that can sometimes arise when working with real data.</li>
		<li>Take the practice quiz. If you feel confident in your answers and get a perfect score, great! You're likely in good shape for the Lesson Quiz. You may want to try the practice quiz again to see if you can score another 100 percent (you'll get a few different questions in the mix the second time).
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>If you score less than 100 percent on your first try, that's a sign that you missed at least one key concept from the lesson (and if your score is low, perhaps many key concepts). In this case, <strong>DON'T immediately take the practice quiz again, and avoid taking it multiple times in rapid succession</strong>. You'll get some repeat questions when taking the practice quiz over and over again in rapid succession, and it's easy to obtain a high score on the practice quiz<em> </em>purely through process of elimination and memorization. But earning a high score in this fashion won't help you when it comes time for the lesson quiz (which won't have all the exact same questions) because you haven't really learned the material<em>, and your<strong> first</strong> score on the practice quiz will be the best indicator of how you'll perform on the lesson quiz.</em></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Use the practice quizzes to point out problem topics in the material. </strong>After you take the practice quiz once, take the questions that you got wrong (and even the ones you got right but guessed at) and <em>learn</em> the answers--understand <em>why</em> you got them wrong. Start by re-reading pertinent sections of the lesson material, and don't forget that I eagerly await your questions in each lesson's <em>"Classroom"</em> discussion. If you're having trouble formulating a question, use a question from the practice quiz as a basis to ask me something.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Now, <em>after re-reading relevant portions of the text and getting your unresolved questions answered</em>, take the practice quiz for a second time. Your score should notably improve. If not, the quiz is telling you that you still have major gaps in your knowledge and you still have studying to do (and perhaps questions to ask). Make sure to let several hours (or even days) pass in between practice quiz attempts. Waiting reduces the chance that you'll get questions right because you've memorized the answers.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Finally, you should be ready to take the lesson quiz. Go back to the "Prioritize" statements and make sure that you feel confident about each one. Remember that the each question on the quiz is mapped to one of these statements.</li>
	</ol>
	Please take this advice from the beginning of the semester and apply it in your approach to this course. I've taught online courses for many years, and I've discovered that occasionally student expectations about what it takes to succeed are unrealistic. Students who hang onto those unrealistic expectations set themselves up for a frustrating experience in METEO 3. But, students who follow the recipe described on this page from the beginning tend to overwhelmingly succeed in this course. I am rooting for you to succeed, and if you have any questions at all about my expectations, please don't hesitate to ask.</div>

	<p>If you are new to Canvas, it is strongly recommended that you complete the <a href="https://psu.instructure.com/courses/1780857">PSU: Canvas Student Orientation</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span>.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>You may also want to review the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-4121"><span>Canvas Student Getting Started Guide</span></a> <span class="print-footnote">[12]</span> to acclimate yourself further, and watch the following (6:47) video:</p>

	<div class="video-wrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/74677642?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640"></iframe></div>

	<div aria-label="expand content" class="toggler"><em><strong>Click for Transcript of Canvas Overview</strong></em></div>

	<div aria-label="additional content">
		<p>In this video, you will get a brief overview of the Canvas user interface. The Canvas user interface has three main components ­ the Dashboard, Global Navigation, and Sidebar. The Dashboard is the first thing you see when you log into Canvas. It provides a high­level overview across all your courses. The Dashboard has two different viewing options:­ the course view or the recent activity stream. The Dashboard course view includes a course card for each of your favorite courses. Each card can include up to four tabs, which represent the four main Canvas features for student course activity: Announcements, Assignments, Discussions, and Files. These tabs mimic visibility and order in Course Navigation, so for instance, if an instructor hides the Announcements link, the Announcements tab will not be displayed. The total number of activities is indicated on the appropriate tab with a number icon. You can directly access these recent activities by clicking the tab.</p>

		<p>You can change a couple settings for your course cards by clicking the card Settings icon. First, you can create nicknames for your courses to help you organize your dashboard. In the Nickname text field, enter the nickname for your course. Click the Apply button. The new nickname will appear. Course nicknames appear in the Dashboard, Course Navigation Menu, course breadcrumbs, and notification emails and only changes the name of the course for the individual user who created the nickname. If users need to know the original name of the course, they can hover over the nickname and the original name will appear. To remove a nickname, open the card settings and remove the nickname. The Nickname field will display the original name of the course. Click the Apply button to save changes. You can also change the color for your course cards. In the card settings, select the color you would like to assign to the card. You can also enter a HEX code for any color. Then click apply.</p>

		<p>To view the recent activity stream, click the toggle to the right. The recent activity stream view contains a stream of recent notifications from all your courses, including announcements, discussions, assignments, and conversations. New or unread activities are shown by the blue indicator dot. You can view the details of each activity by hovering in the notification area and clicking the Show More link. To collapse recent activity, click the Show Less link. You can directly access your recent activities by clicking the link. To remove a notification, click the remove icon.</p>

		<p>Another interface component is the Global Navigation, which is a static menu on the left side of the page that gives you direct access to your courses and other information in Canvas. This menu is accessible from any page within Canvas. To modify your user settings or profile, click the Account link. You can also specify your notification preferences, upload personal files, or manage ePortfolios here. Click the Logout link to Logout of Canvas. To hide the slide­out menu, just click the menu link again or click the close icon. Click the Dashboard link to return to the Canvas Dashboard at any time.</p>

		<p>By clicking Courses, you can access your individual courses or view a list of all courses in which you are enrolled. Here you can customize the courses that display on your Dashboard and in your Courses list by clicking the stars next to the course names. Click Groups to access any groups in which you are enrolled or to view a list of all your groups. Click the Calendar link to view the global calendar, which shows an aggregated view of all assignments and events from each of your courses. The Inbox link will take you to your Conversations. You can compose and send new messages to other students and teachers here, or view any existing conversations. And click the Help link to access help resources, including the Canvas Guides, the Canvas Community, or Canvas Support. If you ever have a problem with Canvas, be sure to click the “Report a Problem” link to get help from a support agent. This link may not be available to all Canvas users.</p>

		<p>The last interface component is the Sidebar. On your dashboard, the sidebar includes a To Do list, Coming Up feed, Recent Feedback, and a View Grades button. The To Do list helps you keep track of assignments that you need to complete. Click any assignment link and Canvas will direct you to the appropriate page. You can also click the close icon next to any item to ignore the assignment. The Coming Up feed lists upcoming assignments and events within your courses. Under Recent Feedback, you will see the latest comments from instructors or peers on previously submitted assignments. Click the View Grades button to quickly access the grades for any of your courses. Note that when viewing Canvas with a small screen resolution, any sidebar content aligns with the bottom of the page.</p>

		<p>Now let’s visit a course and take a look at the course interface. The course interface consists of 4 main components: the Course Navigation, the Content Area, the Breadcrumb Navigation, and the Sidebar. The course navigation menu provides links to the different areas of your course. Your instructors have the ability to customize this menu, so it may vary slightly from course to course. This menu can be collapsed by clicking the menu icon. The content of the course will be displayed in this Content Area. The Breadcrumb Navigation shows your current location within a course and allows you to easily move to a previous screen. The Course Sidebar is similar to the Canvas Sidebar. It includes a View Course Stream link to see recent course activity, as well as your To Do list, Coming Up feed, and Recent Feedback comments.</p>

		<p>You've now completed this Canvas Overview for Students. For additional information on this or any other topic about Canvas, just visit guides.canvaslms.com. You can also ask questions and engage with other Canvas users by visiting community.canvaslms.com.</p>

	<h4>Connection Speed and Multimedia</h4>

	<p>I strongly advise against attempting to take this course using only a dial-up connection (it can be done, but prepare yourself for major-league stress and frustration). We have tried to keep most files small, but some movies may be over a megabyte in size. If you are on a dial-up connection, I suggest saving large files directly to your desktop (right-click on the link and select "Save Target As...") before you need to view them. That way you will not just be<font color="#ff0000"> </font>sitting and waiting for files to download. After you have them saved, you can access them directly by dragging them into an open browser window.</p>

	<h4>Questions? Problems?</h4>

	<p>If you need technical assistance, feel free to post a question in a <em>"Classroom</em>" discussion for any issue involving the course lesson pages or quiz questions.&nbsp; If your problem is more complex or specifically related to Canvas (email, discussion, etc.) please contact the <a href="http://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/technical-support" target="_blank">Outreach Helpdesk</a> <span class="print-footnote">[21]</span>. It is in your own best interest to be as specific as you possibly can when seeking help. Vague descriptions of a problem only delay assistance. Try to include information such as:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Indicate the specific course page, quiz question, etc. you were on, what you attempted to do when that failed, and <strong>the exact language of any error message</strong> displayed on your screen</li>
		<li>The date and time when your problem occurred</li>
		<li>Any other pertinent information (does the problem happen consistently and always in the same way, etc.)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Often times, posting in<em> </em>a <em>"Classroom" </em>discussion may be your fastest avenue for receiving assistance (especially if I can help solve the problem).&nbsp; But, if the problem is beyond my control (particularly if it's a problem with Canvas), I may refer you to the Outreach Helpdesk:</p>
