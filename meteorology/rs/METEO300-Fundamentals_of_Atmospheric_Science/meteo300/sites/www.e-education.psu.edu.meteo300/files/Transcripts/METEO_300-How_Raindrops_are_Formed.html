<p>Now this is a familiar scene. The sun's
heat causes water from plants, lakes, and
oceans to turn from a liquid to a vapor.
High in the atmosphere the water vapor
then cools down and condenses from a gas
back into a liquid. The liquid water then
falls back to the surface in the form of
rain, snow, ice, or hail. Water runs off
into streams lakes and oceans or is
stored in the ground or in snow path.
This is the water cycle and it describes
our most vital resource moves through
the whole earth system, but like most
things in our world when we look at the
tiny parts that make up the whole we can
learn a lot more about the phenomenon.</p><p>

<p>Take the shape of a single raindrop.
Small droplets of water in the
atmosphere are spherical in shape due to
the surface tension or skin of the water
molecules. As these droplets grow they
become heavier and start to fall through
the air. As they fall, the raindrop
collides with other drops and continues
to get bigger. These larger raindrops
fall through the air faster the wind
resistance on the underside of the drop
causes the bottom of the drop to flatten
resulting in a drop looking like a
hamburger bun. As the drop continues to
fall and grow at some point it becomes
too large for the surface tension to
hold it together, so the raindrop breaks
apart into smaller spiracle drops.</p><p>

Investigating the processes we can't see
with the naked eye is nothing new.
Science and technology drive each other
forward and often lead to insights and
discoveries along the way. With the
invention of high-speed photography we
finally saw the most basic elements of
our watery planet in action.
Understanding how a tiny raindrop falls
through the atmosphere does more than
debunk the myth that a raindrop Falls
like a teardrop. It actually makes a
difference when it comes to measuring
precipitation in particular for ground
radars. Ground radars look at the sides
of the raindrops and then estimate the
vertical and horizontal sighs. A heavier,
flatter drop allows radars to identify
heavier precipitation. In fact the two
radars on board the GPM satellite can
also measure drop sizes from space and
so a more accurate look at rain drops
gives us a more accurate look at how
global rainfall is shaping up.</p>
