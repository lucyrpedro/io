<p>Hi it's Mr. Andersen and right now I'm actually playing Angry Birds. Angry Birds
is a video game where you get to launch Angry Birds at these pig type characters.
I like it for two reasons. Number one it's addictive, but number two it deals
with physics and a lot of my favorite games deal with physics.
So let's go to level two. And so, what I'm going to talk about today are vectors
and scalars, and vectors and scalars are ways that we measure quantities in
physics. Angry Birds would be a really boring game if I just use scalars
because if I just use scalars I would input the speed of the bird and then I would
just let it go, and it'd be boring because I wouldn't be able to vary the direction.
And so Angry Birds I can vary the direction and let me try to skip this
off of... nice. I can try to skip it off and and kill enough of these pigs at
once. Now I could play this for the whole 10 minutes but that would probably
be a waste of time. So, what I want to do is talk about scalars and vector
quantities. </p>

<p>Scalar and vector quantities
I wanted to start with them at the beginning of physics because sometimes
we get two vectors and people get confused and don't understand
where did they come from. So, we have quantities that we measure in
science especially in physics and we give numbers and units to those, but they
come in two different types and those are scalar and vector. To kind of
talk about the difference between the two, a scalar quantity is going to be a
quantity where we just measure the magnitude, and so an example of a scalar
quantity could be speed.
So when you measure the speed of something and I say how fast does your
car go, you might say that my car goes
109 miles per hour. Or, if you're a physics teacher you might say that my bike goes,
I don't know like nine point six meters per second,
and so this is going to be speed and the reason it's a scalar quantity is it
simply gives me a magnitude. How fast, how far, how big, how quick.
All those things are scalar quantities. What's missing from a scalar quantity is
direction, and so vector quantities are going to tell you the not only the
magnitude, but they're also going to tell you what direction that magnitude is in.
So, let me use a different color maybe. </p>

<p>Example of a vector quantity would be
velocity, and so in science it's really important that we make this distinction between speed and velocity. Speed is just how fast
something is going, but velocity is also going to contain the direction.
In other words I could say that my bike is going 9.08 m/s West. Or, I could say
this pen is being thrown with initial velocity of two point eight meters per
second up or in the positive. And so, once we add direction to a quantity now we
have a vector.
Now you might think to yourself that's kind of nitpicky. Why do we care what
direction that were flowing in and I have a demonstration that will kind of
show you the importance of that, but a good example would be acceleration.</p>

<p>So what is acceleration? Acceleration is simply
change in velocity over time and so acceleration is going to be the change
in velocity over time. and so I could ask you a question like this.
let's say a car is driving down a road and it's going 23 meters per second and
it stays at 23 meters per second. Is it accelerating? And you would say no
of course it's not. Let's say it goes around a corner and during that movement
around the corner it stays at 23 miles per hour.
Well what would happen to the scalar quantity of speed around the corner?
It would still be 23 meters per second, and so if you're using scalar quantities
we'd have to say that it's not accelerating,
but since the velocity is a vector if you're going 23 miles an hour and you go
around a corner
are you accelerating. Yeah, because you're not changing the magnitude of your speed,
but you're clearly changing the direction and so a change in velocity is
going to be acceleration. And so you are accelerating when you go around a corner.
And so that be an example of why in physics, I'm not trying to be nitpicky
I'm just saying that you have to understand the difference between a
scalar quantity and then which is just magnitude, and a vector which is
magnitude and direction. 
There's a review at the end of this minute video, and so I'll have you go
through a bunch of these and so we'll identify a number of them, but for now I
want to give you a little demonstration.</p>

<p>To show you the importance of a scalar
and vector quantities.
So what I have here is a one thousand gram weight or
one kilogram weight. It's suspended from a scale and I don't know
if you can read that on there but the scale measures the number of grams. And
so, if this is a thousand grams and this measures the number of grams and it's
scaled right it should say and it does about a thousand grams is, is the weight
of this. Now a question I could ask you is this, let's say I bring another scale
and so I'm going to attach another scale to it. And so if we had one mass that had
a mass of a thousand grams, and now I have two scales that are bearing the
weight of that
and I lift them directly up, what should what should each of the scales read. And
if you're thinking well it's a thousand gram so each one should read 500 grams
let me try it. The right answer is, yeah.
Each of the scales ray right at about five hundred grands and so that should
make sense to you.
In other words 500 + 500 is a thousand so we have the force down of the weight
force of tension that's holding these in position, and so we should be good to
go. The problem becomes when I start to change the angle and so what I'm
going to do and I'm sure this will go off screen, is I'm going to start to to
hold these at a different angle.
and so what if they look right here and now find that it's a six hundred and so
this one is at
 600 as well. and so as I increase the angle like this will find that that will
increase as well and so when I get it to an angle like this
I have a thousand gram weight and it's being supported by two scales now that
are reading a thousand. and it's going to vary as I come back to here and if you
do any weight lifting you understand kind of how that works.</p><p>

So the question becomes how do we do math? The problem with this then is
the the numbers don't add up.
And so, if I've got a 500 gram way excuse me a thousand gram weight being
supported by two scales it made sense that it was weighing five hundred each.
But now we all the sudden have a thousand gram weight being supported by
two scales that are reading thousand and so this doesn't make sense or the
math doesn't make sense.
And the reason why is that you're trying to solve the problem from a scalar
perspective, and you'll never be able to get the right answer because it's going
to change its going to change depending on the angle that we lift them at. So, 
to understand this in a a vector method, and we'll get way into detail so I just
kind of wanted to touch on it for just a second.
What we had was a weight so we'll say there's a weight like this and will say
that's a thousand gram weight and then we have two scales and each of those
scales are pulling at 500 grams. So, if you add the vectors up, so this is 1
vector and this is another vector, so each of these are 500 grams so I make
them 500 in length. Then we balance out in other words you have the balancing of
this weight with these two weights that are on top of it. Now if we go to the
vector problem the vector problem again we had a thousand gram weights a thousand grams
in the middle, and then we had a force in this direction of a thousand and a force
in that direction of the thousand. So we had the force down of a thousand, but
 we had a force of a thousand in this direction and a force of a thousand
in that direction. And so, if you start to look of it at it like a vector quantity
imagine this that we've gotta weight right here but you have to have two people
pulling on it and so it's like this tug-of-war where it's not just in one
direction but it's actually in two. And so you can start to see how these forces
are going to balance out, but only if we look at it from the vector perspective.
 Let me show you what that would actually look like.
So if we put these tails up this would be that force down of a thousand grams.
This would be the force of the weight, but we also had a force in this
direction so I'm doing the same rule where I'm lining up my vector from the
tail to the tip and the tail to the tip. And so that diagram that I had in the
last slide
I'm actually moving this one force and you can see that they all sum up to 0.
and so the reason I like to start talking about vectors and scalars with
this problem is that you can never solve the problem if you're going to go at it
from a scalar perspective. and we're going to do some really cool problems
let's say I'm sliding a box across the floor, but how often do you slide a box
across the floor and actually pull it straight across like that?
if you're like me you're pulling a sled or something you normally pulling it at
an angle and once we start playing at an angle becomes a totally different for us
and we can't solve problems in the scalar way we have to go and solve it
from the vector perspective and so that's the importance of vectors. on now
it's a huge thing.
So there are lots of things that we can measure in physics and so what I'm going
to try to do hopefully can get this right is go through and circle all the
scalar quantities and then go back and circle all the vector quantities. And so
if you're watching this video a good thing to do would be pause right now
and then you go through in and circle the ones that you think are scalar and
vector, and then we'll see if we match up the end.</p>

<p>Scalar quantities remember
is simply going to be magnitude. And so the question I always ask myself when I'm doing this is, ok does it have a direction?
Length is simply the length of a side of something, so
I would put that in the scalar perspective. This is kind of
philosophical, does time have a direction? I would say
no. Acceleration we already talked about that. That's changing in velocity.
What about density, the density of something. That definitely is a scalar
quantity. If I say the density of that is 12.8 grams per cubic centimeter North
that doesn't make sense at all. What are some other scalar quantities? Temperature would
be a scalar quantity.
It's just how fast the molecules are moving,  but it's not in one certain
direction. Pressure would be another one that is scalar.
It's not directional. It's not in one direction, the pressure is remember,
pressure air pressure is the one that I always think of is going to be in all
direction, so we wouldn't say that.
Let's see, mass. The mass of something is going to be a scalar quantity as well so
it it doesn't change. Now wait and we'll talk more about that later and
would actually be a a vector quantity.
let's see if I'm missing any. now I think this would be good so let's change color
for a second. So, displacement is how far you move from a location and that's in a
direction. So we call that a vector quantity acceleration I mentioned before.
force is going to be a vector and will do these force diagrams which are really
fun later in the year.
Drag is something slowing you down, so if your car it's what's slowing you down in
the opposite direction of your movement, so the direction is important.
Momentum is a product of velocity in the mass of an object, and lift we get from
like an airplane wing. That would be a vector quantity because it's in a
direction. So these are all vector quantities, the ones that I circled in
red, but there are way more that we're going to find out there. And scalar
quantities remember it's simply just magnitude or how big it is. And so as we
go through physics be thinking to yourself
is this a scalar quantity or vector? And if it's vector,
my problem is a little bit harder, but like Angry Birds
it's more fun when you go the vector route. And so, I hope that's helpful and
have a great day!</p>
