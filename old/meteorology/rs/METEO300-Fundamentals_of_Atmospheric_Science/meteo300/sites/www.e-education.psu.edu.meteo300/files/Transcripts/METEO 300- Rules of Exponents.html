<p>In this video we're going to be talking about all of the basic rules of
exponents. And remember, when we're talking about exponents we can have an
exponent here like X to the fourth where x is the base what we call the base and
four is the exponent this small number in the upper right hand corner. It means
that we're going to multiply X by itself four times or it means we have four
factors of X multiplied together. So, if we expand this out its x times X times X
times X. if we collapse it its X to the fourth.</p>

<p>So, what happens when we do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
of exponents? Well, in all cases we have to be really careful about like terms.
For example, when we add terms that have exponents in them together both the
bases and the exponents have to be the same in order for us to add them
together. So, if we look at this first example 3x squared plus 2x squared the
base here is X and the base here is X so the bases are the same which is good
because we need that. and the exponents we have 2 and 2 which is good because we
also need the exponents to be the same in order to add these together. So
basically we have 3x squared added to 2x squared is going to give us five of
them, 5x squared. </p><p>

<p>So, if you're going to do addition and subtraction the bases and
the exponents have to be the same. In this case we have X to the third plus x
squared our bases X are the same but our exponents are different we have three
and two. These are not like terms, so we can't add these together we can't simplify this at
all. What happens when we do subtraction well again we're looking for similar
basis so we have X and X for our base and then we have exponents of four and
four. So because the bases and the exponents of the scene we can combine
these like terms. We have six of them were subtracting and applied one of them
which is going to leave us with five of them. So 5 times X to the fourth, but in
this problem despite having the same base they will have a base of X we have
different exponents we have a 4 and a 3 and because we're doing subtraction we
can't combine these. We can't simplify this at all. </p>

<p>What happens when we
multiply two values together where exponents are involved?
Well, here in order to simplify
all we care about is that the bases are the same. The exponents do not have to be
the same. So here we have base X and base X and we know already that's all we need
to multiply these together it doesn't matter that the exponents are also the
same we just add them. So we have three times to these are coefficients on our x
squared terms. We multiply those together. So three times two is six, so that's
going to be the first part and then we have x squared times x squared. And if we
look at that x squared times x squared what we're going to do is add the
exponents together. And the reason is because if we expand these out
we know that x squared is two factors of X multiplied together. We're multiplying
that by another x squared, so we're multiplying that by two more factors of
X multiplied together. All together this is X to the fourth.
Which we know because this essentially becomes the rule x to the a x x to the B
is X to the a plus B. We just add the exponents together. So two plus two is
four we get X to the fourth.</p><p>

Here's another example we have X to the third
times x squared remember there's an implied one coefficient in front of both
of these when we multiply 1 x 1 we get one so there will be a implied one
coefficient on our final answer. x cubed + x squared. We just care that the bases
are the same and they both have a base X so we know will be able to multiply them
together. We have X to the third times x squared and remember that is going to be
X to the three plus two so when we simplify we get X to the fifth and that
should make sense because we have 3 factors of x x 2 factors of X adding
them all up we get five factors of X so X to the fifth. </p>
<p>
The quotient rule for
exponents tells us that in the same way as when we multiplied we didn't have to
have the same exponent. When we divide we also don't have to have the same
exponent we only care about the bases so here we have like basis. We have base X
for both of these the exponents happened to be the same but that doesn't matter
we're just going to leave this six and our final answer, so we'll get six here.
And then what we're going to do is subtract the exponent in the denominator
from the exponent in the numerator so the result is going to be X to the 4
minus 4. This is the four from the numerator this is the four from the
denominator. 4-4 is 0 so we get 6 x 20 x to the 0 is 1 so this is 6 times 1 or
just six.
Even if we have different numbers again we only care about the bases both of
these have the same base of X so again we'll just keep our two and our final
answer and then we'll have X to the 4-3 because we say numerator exponent minus
denominator exponent. That's going to give us 2 times X to the 4 minus 3 is 1.
so X to the first which is of course just equal to 2x. 
</p><p>
What about a power
raised to another power or an exponent raised to another exponent? Well, just
like before in this example here when we said X to the fourth means multiply X by
itself four times here we're saying
multiply x squared by itself three times. So this is going to be equal to x
squared times x squared times x squared and now we're really just back at this
right here for multiplying like bases together and we add the exponents. So,
this is just the same as X to the two plus two plus two. Two plus two plus two
is six so we get x to the sixth power. What we realize then is that we can
expand this and then add the exponents together using this rule over here or we
can just multiply these two exponents together. Two times three gives us six
and so we can do it that way as well. We can even do this when we have a negative
base. So this problem here is telling us multiply 3 factors of negative x squared
together so this is going to be negative x squared times negative x squared times
negative x squared. We can deal with the negatives separately. Remember we can
cancel every two negatives and they become a positive so negative and
negative become a positive we're just left with this single negative sign here.
so our answer will be negative and then x squared times x squared times x
squared we know is X to the sixth.</p><p>

You can also think about it this way when you have this negative sign inside
the parentheses. It's the same thing as saying negative 1 times x squared all
raised to the third power and then you can apply this exponent to the negative
1 negative 1 times negative 1 times negative 1 is going to give you negative
1 which is this part right here. And then x squared to the third is going to be X
to the 60 you get this X to the sixth and when you multiply them together you
get negative x to the sixth. So those are just some of the most basic exponent
rules that you need to know.</p>
