<p>Hey guys how do you solve ideal gas law questions involving density?
The key is to have a formula or know how to derive the formula on your own.
Remember density is mass over volume.
Now, the way that mass is found in the ideal gas law equation is in n because
the number of moles is the same as mass over molar mass. So, check this set.
I'm going to replace n with mass over molar mass, and then I'm going to
rearrange for m over v.
I'm going to undo division by molar mass on the other side and then I'm going to
undo multiplication by RT and bring my V over. Here's a what I mean.
P times the molar mass divided by RT gives me mass over volume. Mass over
volume is density and so my equation is density equals pressure times molar mass
divided by RT. We can now use this equation to find the density of oxygen
at 55 Celsius and a hundred and three kilopascals. So let's do it.
The density is pressure that's 103 kilopascals times molar mass for oxygen.
That's 32 grams per mole.
R, now, I'm going to put my volume in liters and I'm going to put my pressure
in kilopascals which means the relevant are that I want is 8.314 liters,
kilopascals per mole Kelvin and my temperature in Kelvin is the temperature
in Celsius plus 273, which gives me 328 Kelvin. And all of these units should cancel out
 to give me a density unit.
Kelvin cancels of Kelvin per moles cancel / moles kilopascals canceled the
scale pascals and left with grams per liter.
Let's do this on the calculator 103 times 32 divided 8.314 divided 328.
That's 1.21 grams per liter.
That may not seem like a lot, but remember you're dealing with the gas here. If you
have a 1-liter balloon how much is it actually going to weigh?
Probably the amount of the rubber plus like a gram or so.
This here is the density of oxygen gas at 55 and 103 kilopascals. This is
your density formula in terms of the ideal gas law. Be able to use it. Best of luck!</p>
