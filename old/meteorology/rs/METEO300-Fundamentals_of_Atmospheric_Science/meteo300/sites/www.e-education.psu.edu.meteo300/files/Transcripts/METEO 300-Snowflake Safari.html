<p>FLORA LICHTMAN: Sure there's sledding, snowmen, skiing, but
a winter storm can also mean safari.</p>
 
<p>KEN LIBBRECHT: You
really just need a snowy day. Take a
magnifying glass, go out, there's all sorts of different
things you can see.</p>

<p>FLORA LICHTMAN: That's Ken Libbrecht,
the physicist at Caltech who also
happens to be a snowflake expert. He's
been hunting flakes for years and
documenting them before they melt with
this microscope camera rig.</p>

 <p>KEN LIBBRECHT: My travel
with that the hard part is getting it
through airport security.</p>

<p>FLORA LICHTMAN: Snow crystals
come in roughly 35 flavors Libbrecht says.
Some more common than others of course.</p>

<p>KEN LIBBRECHT: Stellar dendrites are pretty common
 standard sort of shopping mall
snowflake with six branches. </p>

<p>FLORA LICHTMAN:
Then there's
the variant fern-like stellar dendrites.</p>


<p>KEN LIBBRECHT: ...and they look like a little bitty ferns.</p>

<p>FLORA LICHTMAN: Also common are...</p>

 <p>KEN LIBBRECHT: ..needles, columns. One
of my favorites are capped columns.</p>

<p>FLORA LICHTMAN: Which look kind of like a satellite or...</p>

<p>KEN LIBBRECHT:...two wheels on axle. Unfortunately the
most common thing you'll find is just
kind of junky looking snow looks like
sand.</p>

<p>FLORA LICHTMAN: The least common, the ivory-billed
woodpecker of snowflakes is big...</p>

<p>KEN LIBBRECHT: ...five
millimeters in diameter and nicely
symmetrical with lots of intricate
markings. Those are really gorgeous
and hard to find.</p>

 <p>FLORA LICHTMAN: But you can increase
your chances if you seek out snowflake
hotspots.</p>

 <p>KEN LIBBRECHT: Northern Ontario is a good spot.
Vermont and Michigan and I have been there.
 Northern Japan actually is
pretty good. I'm anxious to try to
Siberia.</p>

 <p>FLORA LICHTMAN: See certain conditions breed
better crystals. </p>

<p>KEN LIBBRECHT: The best temperature is
around five degrees Fahrenheit. Sometimes
though you can see it's really nice
crystals just below freezing.</p>

<p>FLORA LICHTMAN: Ok a little review of where snowflakes
come from. They're born in the clouds.
It all starts with a speck of dust or
bacterium.</p>

<p>KEN LIBBRECHT: Gunk in the air.</p>

<p>FLORA LICHTMAN:...and the gunk floats
around the cloud.</p>

<p>KEN LIBBRECHT:...for half a mile.</p>

<p>FLORA LICHTMAN: Picking up water molecules.</p>


<p>KEN LIBBRECHT: Then they shuffle around a little bit
until they find the right spot to sit in
and that the water molecules themselves
are lined up in the hexagonal array.
That's where the the order is generated.</p>


<p>FLORA LICHTMAN: ...and that order is what makes it a
crystal.</p>

<p>KEN LIBBRECHT:...and as a grows larger the points
of the hexagon stick out a little bit in
the air so each of the six corners
sprouts and arm and that's one of the
things we're trying to understand in
details how crystals grow. </p>

<p>FLORA LICHTMAN: The details of
that growth are determined by the
microenvironment, the flake encounters, as
it travels through the cloud.</p>

<p>KEN LIBBRECHT: Humidity is
low the crystals grow slow and humidity
is high they go fast.</p>

 <p>FLORA LICHTMAN: In other words of
flakes identity is shaped by the
environment it grows up in and because
two snow crystals aren't likely to follow
the exact same path, you're not likely to
find two of the exact same flake. Just
how environment affects crystal growth
is something Librecht  studies in the lab,
by growing his own snowflakes.</p>


<p>KEN LIBBRECHT: We call these designer snowflakes. You can sort of 
dial-up what you want.</p>

<p>FLORA LICHTMAN: Give it the right
environment and something to grow on and it'll build itself.</p>

<p>KEN LIBBRECHT: A really nice example
of how really complicated structures
emerged spontaneously not alive
test the DNA or anything like that
genetic code. It just happens. To
understand more about how works will be
able to use it for something or at the
very least we'll just understand how it
works.
</p>

<p>FLORA LICHTMAN: Happy new year. For Science Friday, I'm
Flora Lichtman.</p>
