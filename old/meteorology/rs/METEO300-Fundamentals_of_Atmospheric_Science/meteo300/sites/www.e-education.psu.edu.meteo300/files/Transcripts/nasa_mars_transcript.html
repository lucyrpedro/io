<p>Remember when NASA lost a spacecraft because it's simultaneously used
Imperial and metric measurements on the same mission? The Mars Climate Orbiter
disappeared 15 years ago this month
and here's a very brief recap of exactly what went wrong.</p>

<p>The Mars Climate Orbiter launched on December 11, 1998 on a mission to orbit
Mars. This first interplanetary weather satellite was designed to gather data on
Mars' climate and also serve as a relay station for the Mars Polar Lander, a
mission that launched a few weeks later. But you can't just launched a spacecraft
towards Mars and trust that it's going to get where it's going. You to have to monitor
its progress. </p>

<p>Many spacecraft have reaction wheels to keep them oriented
properly and navigation teams behind interplanetary spacecraft that
constantly monitor the angular momentum and adjust trajectory to make sure it
gets exactly where it needs to go. In the case of the Mars Climate Orbiter,
monitoring its trajectory and angular momentum involved a few steps. 

<p>First, data
from the spacecraft was transferred to the ground by telemetry. There it was
processed by a software program and stored in an angular momentum
desaturation file that process data was what scientists used to adjust the
trajectory. Adjustments that were made by firing the spacecraft's thrusters.
Every time the thrusters were fired, the resulting change in velocity was
measured twice once by software program on the spacecraft and once by software
program off the ground. And here's where the problem comes in.
It turned out that the two systems the processing software on the spacecraft
and the software on the ground
we're using two different units of measurements. The software on the
spacecraft measured impulse, or the changes by thrusters in newton seconds a
commonly accepted metric unit of measurement, while the processing
software on the ground use the Imperial pound seconds. And it was unfortunately
the ground computer's data that scientists used to update the spacecraft
trajectory and because one pound of force is equal to 4.45 Newton's every adjustment was off
by a factor of 4.45. 

</p><p>For a spacecraft traveling tens of millions of
miles to destination a number of seemingly small errors really add up.
During the Mars Climate Orbiters nine-month cruise to Mars seven errors
were introduced into its trajectory that meant that when it reached the red
planet it was 105 miles closer to the Martian surface than expected.
This turned out to be an unsurvivably low altitude for its Mars encounter
when the spacecraft fire its main engine for the orbit insertion burn that was
designed to put it into an elliptical orbit
nothing happened. NASA lost contact quite abruptly with the spacecraft.</p>

<p>So while we know the root cause of just what went wrong we'll never know exactly
what happened to the Mars Climate Orbiter. The loss of the Mars Climate
Orbiter very sadly happened in space.</p><p>
