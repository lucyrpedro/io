<p>We're all pretty familiar with what O2 is. I hope so.
You need to breathe it to live. Yes,
O2 is oxygen, that life-giving gas, but what is O3? O3 is another gas essential
to our survival but it's definitely not for breathing.
O3 is ozone high up in the stratosphere.
It's made naturally and absorbs harmful ultraviolet rays from the Sun. Without it
life as we know it wouldn't, couldn't exist.
We need the ozone layer in the stratosphere. We want it, we rely on it.
But don't get too used to singing ozone's praises. High ozone levels at lower
altitudes, what we call the troposphere, where we live and breathe or anything but natural
and beneficial. In fact, down here
it turns out to be a toxic atmospheric pollutants. Yep, you heard me right.
ground-level ozone primarily exists due to human activities that burn fossil
fuels. Transportation,
our power and industrial plants, and other activities expel nitrogen oxides
and hydrocarbons.
When those compounds interact with sunlight, voila,
ozone is created a contributor to smog.
that's why I ozone levels increase during the summer months when sunlight
is abundant. Yes, smog love summer just like many of us. We run, bike, hike, fish, play, stroll,
oh yeah, and breathe. Yes, the fact that more people are outside when it's warmer
makes us particularly vulnerable to Ozone's harmful impacts.</p><p>

Ozone is a harmful oxidant when we inhale it it's like getting a sunburn
inside your lungs and it can be particularly serious for the young, old,
active, and those with respiratory conditions at any age.
And it's not just humans that are vulnerable ozone harms plants, crops, and
agricultural yield interfering with pretty important processes like well,
photosynthesis and even our economy. To make matters worse
ozone production increases with higher temperatures which are occurring more
frequently with climate change.</p><p>

The EPA sets national ambient air quality standards for several pollutants
in the United States including ground level ozone. When a county is out of
compliance
they need to know what can be done to improve air quality. and let's not forget
that air pollution is a global comments.
air pollution is shared from surrounding cities states and also country's halfway
around the world.
What can we do, what are we willing to do to improve current levels? Drive less,
carpool, avoid car idling,
set your home's thermostat higher in the summer and lower in the winter,
avoid gas powered lawn & garden tools on severe ozone days.</p><p>

There's a lot to do and lots to know about air quality knowing more about the
sources and contributors to ozone and other atmospheric pollutants will help
us chart our course.</p>
