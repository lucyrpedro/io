<h4>Quick Facts about <em>METEO 3</em></h4>

<p><em>METEO</em> 3 is a General Education course offered by the Department of Meteorology. The course is designed specifically for distance learners seeking general science credit. <em>METEO</em> 3 will introduce to you a wide variety of basic atmospheric concepts so that you can become a better "weather consumer" (better understand and evaluate weather information) and gain a better understanding of "how the weather works."</p>

<h4>Why learn about the atmosphere?</h4>

<div class="image-right-35"><img alt="Portrait of Benjamin Franklin" src="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/images/lesson0/franklinwithkey.jpg">
	<div class="image-caption">"Benjamin Franklin Drawing Electricity from the Sky" by Benjamin West (1738-1820).</div>

	<div class="image-credit">Phil. Mus. of Art</div>
</div>

<p>Most everyone is familiar with Benjamin Franklin's foray into cloud electrification using a kite. However, did you know that Franklin was an avid student of the weather? He was the first person to note that storms generally traveled from west to east at predictable speeds. Franklin also noted in 1743 that storms do not always travel in the direction of the prevailing winds - in fact can travel <em>against</em> the prevailing winds in some cases!</p>

<p>Granted, Benjamin Franklin dabbled in many diverse topics, but why did he find the study of weather so important? Perhaps Franklin found the weather to be so important because it so profoundly affects <em>everyone</em>. Think about it. No matter where you live or what you do, weather is going to have some impact on your life. Weather helps determine the types of clothes we wear, may impact your source of income, and on rare occasions, it may affect your very health and safety (think about extreme events like hurricanes, tornadoes, or floods). In whatever way the weather affects you, one thing is for sureâ€¦ the weather <em>does</em> affect you.</p>

<p>So then, doesn't it make sense to know something about how the atmosphere works and make use of the many types of weather data available to you? I certainly think so! However, I am continually startled that a lot of people know so very little about something that plays such a pivotal role in their lives. Indeed, many people are interested <em>in</em> the weather, but not necessarily interested in learning <em>about</em> the weather. Hopefully, as a result of this course, you will come away with some very practical knowledge about the weather. This knowledge will make you a better weather consumer (that is, someone who can intelligently process weather information presented to you). And, who knows, this knowledge may even save your life! In the words of Ben Franklin, you'll be "weather-wise."</p>

<h4>What will you learn in this course?</h4>

<p><em>METEO</em> 3 seeks to give you a better understanding of atmospheric structure and processes so you can better apply the weather information you encounter. With this knowledge of how the atmosphere works, you'll be able to understand what controls the evolution of storms and appreciate why weather forecasts are sometimes highly uncertain. You will also learn to "read" the sky so you can make your own short-term forecasts and adjust your behavior accordingly. You will also be better able to assess the validity of the commonly expressed concerns about climate change and deteriorating air quality.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Lesson 12: Hurricanes</strong> (tropical cyclone terms, hurricane climatology, tropical-cyclone naming conventions, ingredients for tropical cyclone formation and processes for strengthening, land-falling hurricane impacts, assessing hurricane damage potential)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Lesson 13: Becoming a Savvy Weather Consumer</strong> (historical perspective on how weather forecasts are made, computer models and their sources of error, ensemble forecasting, assessing forecast accuracy, common sources of weather forecasts, forecast scenarios with great uncertainty, finding trusted sources of weather information on social media)</p>

<h4>How does this course work?</h4>

<p><em>METEO</em> 3 uses an online text, which includes digital video, audio, simulation models, virtual field trips to on-line data resources, and interactive quizzes that provide instantaneous feedback. The course consists of 12 lessons, plus a course orientation week at the beginning of the semester. Lessons consist of an online reading assignment, along with online interactive exercises, links, animations, movies, and supplementary explanations of basic scientific principles.</p>
