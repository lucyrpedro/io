<h3 class="internalLink"><a name="overview"></a>General Course Structure</h3>

<p><em>METEO 3: INTRODUCTORY METEOROLOGY (3 credits).</em> <em>Nontechnical treatment of fundamentals of modern meteorology and the effects of weather and climate. Prerequisites: None</em></p>

<p><em>METEO</em> <em>3</em> is a General Education course offered by the Department of Meteorology. The course is designed specifically for distance learners seeking general science credit. <em>METEO 3 </em>will introduce to you a wide variety of basic atmospheric concepts so that you can become a better "weather consumer" (better understand and evaluate weather information) and gain a better understanding of "how the weather works."</p>

<p><em>METEO 3</em> uses online text with digital video, audio, simulation models, virtual field trips to online data resources, and interactive quizzes that provide instantaneous feedback. The course consists of 12 lessons, plus a course orientation week at the beginning of the semester. Lessons consist of an online reading assignment, which includes interactive exercises, links, animations, movies, and supplementary explanations of basic scientific principles.</p>

<h4>Course Objectives</h4>

<p>When you successfully complete this course, you will be prepared to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>describe the typical vertical variation of the basic variables used to quantify the atmospheric state, including temperature, pressure, humidity, winds, and natural and anthropogenic particles</li>
	<li>describe the basic techniques used by meteorologists (and other scientists) to gather and interpret atmospheric data</li>
	<li>discuss climate and climate change, together with the possible influences that humans have on diverse climate phenomena</li>
	<li>analyze the forces that drive three-dimensional atmospheric motions</li>
	<li>identify basic cloud types and discuss their formation mechanisms, together with the precipitation types and other materials that precipitation cleanses from the air</li>
	<li>describe a variety of large-scale atmospheric phenomena, including the extratropical cyclone, the jet stream, and the general circulation</li>
	<li>describe a variety of mesoscale and small-scale atmospheric phenomena, including tropical storms, severe thunderstorms, and tornadoes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What I expect of you</h4>

<p>On average, most successful students will likely spend roughly 8-10 hours each week completing assigned readings and other exercises, on par with what the university estimates for a typical 3-credit course. Your workload may be a bit more or less depending on your prior experience with computing and the Web, and with meteorology in particular.</p>

<p>I have worked hard to make this the most effective and convenient educational experience possible. The Internet is still a novel learning environment, but in one sense it is no different from a traditional college class: how much and how well you learn is ultimately up to you. You will succeed if you are diligent about keeping up with the class schedule and if you take advantage of opportunities to communicate with me, as well as with your fellow students. It's important to<strong> log into the course at least three times a week </strong>(on different days) in order to check your course e-mail, the discussions, and any course announcements that I've posted. <em>Falling out of touch with course happenings for weeks at a time is a big way to jeopardize your chances of success in an online course.</em></p>

<h3><a name="assignments"></a>Assignments and Grading</h3>

<p>Three components of assessment will comprise your final grade in <em>METEO 3</em>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>"Taking Your Temperature" Surveys ...5%</li>
	<li>Lab Exercises ... 40%</li>
	<li>Lesson Quizzes ... 30%</li>
	<li>A Final Exam ... 25%</li>
</ul>

<p>Detailed information about these requirements is covered in <em>Course Assignments</em> in <em>Course Orientation.</em></p>

<p>The grading scale below indicates the general standards I use in <em>METEO 3</em>. Depending on the performance of the class, grades may be curved to students' advantage.</p>

<h4>Course Copyright</h4>

<p>All course materials students receive or to which students have online access are protected by copyright laws. Students may use course materials and make copies for their own use as needed, but unauthorized distribution and/or uploading of materials without the instructor’s express permission is strictly prohibited. University Policy AD 40, the University Policy Recording of Classroom Activities and Note Taking Services addresses this issue. Students who engage in the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials may be held in violation of the University’s Code of Conduct, and/or liable under Federal and State laws.</p>

<p>For example, uploading completed labs, homework, or other assignments to any study site constitutes a violation of this policy.</p>

<h4>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h4>

<p>Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The <a href="http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources">Office for Student Disability Resources</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span> website provides contact information for <a href="http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/campus-disability-coordinators">Campus Disability Coordinators </a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span>at every Penn State campus. For further information, please visit the <a href="http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources">Office for Student Disability Resources</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span> website</p>

<p>In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled. You will participate in an intake interview and provide documentation. See documentation guidelines at <a href="http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/applying-for-services">Applying for Services from Student Disability Resources</a> <span class="print-footnote">[12]</span>. If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.</p>

<h4>Counseling and Psychological Services</h4>

<p>Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing.  The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings.  These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.  Services include the following:</p>

	Counseling Services at <a href="http://senate.psu.edu/faculty/counseling-services-at-commonwealth-campuses/">Commonwealth Campuses</a> <span class="print-footnote">[14]</span><br />
	Penn State Crisis Line (24 hours/7 days/week): 877-229-6400<br />
	Crisis Text Line (24 hours/7 days/week): Text LIONS to 741741</p>

<h4>Reporting Bias-Motivated Incidents</h4>

<p>Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin, race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated (<a href="https://policy.psu.edu/policies/ad29">Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance</a> <span class="print-footnote">[15]</span>) and can be reported through Educational Equity via <a href="http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/">Report Bias</a> <span class="print-footnote">[16]</span>.</p>

<h4>Military Personnel</h4>

<p>Veterans and currently serving military personnel and/or spouses with unique circumstances (e.g., upcoming deployments, drill/duty requirements, disabilities, VA appointments, etc.) are welcome and encouraged to communicate these, in advance if possible, to the instructor in the case that special arrangements need to be made.</p>

<h4>Inclement Weather</h4>

<p>In case of weather-related delays at the University, this online course will proceed as planned. Your instructor will inform you if there are any extenuating circumstances regarding content or activity due dates in the course due to weather delays. If you are affected by a weather-related emergency, please contact your instructor at the earliest possible time to make special arrangements.</p>

<h4>Connect Online with Caution</h4>

<p>Penn State is committed to educational access for all. Our students come from all walks of life and have diverse life experiences. As with any other online community, the lack of physical interaction in an online classroom can create a false sense of anonymity and security. While one can make new friends online, digital relationships can also be misleading. Good judgment and decision making are critical when choosing to disclose personal information to others whom you do not know.</p>
</p>

<p><h4>Deferred Grades</h4>

<p>If you are prevented from completing this course within the prescribed amount of time for reasons that are beyond your control, it is possible to have the grade deferred with the concurrence of the instructor, following <a href="http://senate.psu.edu/policies-and-rules-for-undergraduate-students/47-00-48-00-and-49-00-grades/#48-40">Penn State Deferred Grade Policy 48-40</a> <span class="print-footnote">[17]</span>. To seek a deferred grade, you must submit a written request (by e-mail or U.S. post) to the  instructor describing the reason(s) for the request. Non-emergency permission for filing a deferred grade must be requested before the beginning of the final examination period.  It is up to the instructor to determine whether or not you will be permitted to receive a deferred grade. If permission is granted, you will work with the instructor to establish a communication plan and a clear schedule for completion within policy.  If for any reason, the coursework for the deferred grade is not complete by the assigned time, a grade of "F" will be automatically entered on your transcript.</p>
</p>

<p><div id="attendance">
	<h4>Attendance</h4>

	<p>This course will be conducted entirely online. There will be no set class meeting times, but you will be required to complete weekly assignments with specific due dates. Many of the assignments are open for multiple days, so it is your responsibility to complete the work early if you plan to travel or participate in national holidays, religious observances or University approved activities.</p>

	<p>If you need to request an exception due to a personal or medical emergency, contact the instructor directly as soon as you are able. Such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
</div>
</p>
