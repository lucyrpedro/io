&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;Topofpage&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Please note that I divided the syllabus into several sections. You can read it sequentially by scrolling down the length of this page or simply by clicking on any of the links in the list below (to “jump” to a specific section). Without reservation, it is crucial that you read the &lt;strong&gt;entire&lt;/strong&gt; page (and the the material covered on the other pages of the course orientation). Together, they constitute an informal course &quot;contract&quot; between you and me.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE: &lt;/strong&gt;All communication between instructor and students is reserved for the Canvas discussions (academic and technical issues) and Canvas e-mail (personal issues). For more details, please read &lt;em&gt;Course Communication&lt;/em&gt; under &lt;em&gt;Course Orientation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;technical&quot; name=&quot;technical&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Technical Assistance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;re studying the course content in &lt;em&gt;METEO 3&lt;/em&gt; and encounter a lesson page with a broken link or you have trouble viewing one of the animations or images, feel free to post a question to the appropriate &lt;em&gt;&quot;Classroom&quot;&lt;/em&gt; discussion, located in each module in Canvas. I&#039;ll do my best to determine the cause of the problem and get it fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you&#039;re having trouble with Canvas (posting to a discussion, sending an email, taking a quiz, etc.), please use the Help button located in the left banner of the Canvas environment. You will notice that there are several options. First, I would try the Canvas Guides (they are an excellent resource).&amp;nbsp;However, if you still are stuck, use the &quot;Report a Problem for World Campus Courses&quot; option to contact the &lt;strong&gt;Outreach Helpdesk&lt;/strong&gt;. When describing your issue, try to be as specific as you possibly can. Include information such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Indicate the specific part of Canvas you&#039;re having trouble with, what you attempted to do when that failed, and &lt;strong&gt;the exact language of any error message&lt;/strong&gt; displayed on your screen&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The date and time when your problem occurred&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Any other pertinent information (does the problem happen consistently and always in the same way, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Outreach Helpdesk&lt;br&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;internalLink&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;General Course Structure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;METEO 3: INTRODUCTORY METEOROLOGY (3 credits).&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nontechnical treatment of fundamentals of modern meteorology and the effects of weather and climate. Prerequisites: None&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;METEO&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt; is a General Education course offered by the Department of Meteorology. The course is designed specifically for distance learners seeking general science credit. &lt;em&gt;METEO 3 &lt;/em&gt;will introduce to you a wide variety of basic atmospheric concepts so that you can become a better &quot;weather consumer&quot; (better understand and evaluate weather information) and gain a better understanding of &quot;how the weather works.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;METEO 3&lt;/em&gt; uses online text with digital video, audio, simulation models, virtual field trips to online data resources, and interactive quizzes that provide instantaneous feedback. The course consists of 12 lessons, plus a course orientation week at the beginning of the semester. Lessons consist of an online reading assignment, which includes interactive exercises, links, animations, movies, and supplementary explanations of basic scientific principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Course Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you successfully complete this course, you will be prepared to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;describe the typical vertical variation of the basic variables used to quantify the atmospheric state, including temperature, pressure, humidity, winds, and natural and anthropogenic particles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;describe the basic techniques used by meteorologists (and other scientists) to gather and interpret atmospheric data&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;discuss climate and climate change, together with the possible influences that humans have on diverse climate phenomena&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;analyze the forces that drive three-dimensional atmospheric motions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;identify basic cloud types and discuss their formation mechanisms, together with the precipitation types and other materials that precipitation cleanses from the air&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;describe a variety of large-scale atmospheric phenomena, including the extratropical cyclone, the jet stream, and the general circulation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;describe a variety of mesoscale and small-scale atmospheric phenomena, including tropical storms, severe thunderstorms, and tornadoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What I expect of you&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, most successful students will likely spend roughly 8-10 hours each week completing assigned readings and other exercises, on par with what the university estimates for a typical 3-credit course. Your workload may be a bit more or less depending on your prior experience with computing and the Web, and with meteorology in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked hard to make this the most effective and convenient educational experience possible. The Internet is still a novel learning environment, but in one sense it is no different from a traditional college class: how much and how well you learn is ultimately up to you. You will succeed if you are diligent about keeping up with the class schedule and if you take advantage of opportunities to communicate with me, as well as with your fellow students. It&#039;s important to&lt;strong&gt; log into the course at least three times a week &lt;/strong&gt;(on different days) in order to check your course e-mail, the discussions, and any course announcements that I&#039;ve posted. &lt;em&gt;Falling out of touch with course happenings for weeks at a time is a big way to jeopardize your chances of success in an online course.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;materials&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Required Course Materials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to have an active Penn State Access Account user ID and password (used to access the online course lessons and other materials). If you have any questions about obtaining or activating your Penn State Access Account, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/contacts-help&quot;&gt;contact the World Campus&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;assignments&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Assignments and Grading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three components of assessment will comprise your final grade in &lt;em&gt;METEO 3&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&quot;Taking Your Temperature&quot; Surveys ...5%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lab Exercises ... 40%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lesson Quizzes ... 30%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A Final Exam ... 25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed information about these requirements is covered in &lt;em&gt;Course Assignments&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Course Orientation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grading scale below indicates the general standards I use in &lt;em&gt;METEO 3&lt;/em&gt;. Depending on the performance of the class, grades may be curved to students&#039; advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this course, we recommend the minimum technical requirements outlined on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.e-education.psu.edu/techspecs&quot;&gt;Dutton Institute Technical Requirements &lt;/a&gt;page, including the requirements listed for same-time, synchronous communications. If you need technical assistance at any point during the course, please contact the &lt;a href=&quot;http://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/student-services/helpdesk&quot;&gt;HelpDesk&lt;/a&gt; (for World Campus students) or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pennstate.service-now.com/sp&quot;&gt;IT Service Desk&lt;/a&gt; (for students at all other campus locations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Internet Connection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to a reliable Internet connection is required for this course. A problem with your Internet access may not be used as an excuse for late, missing, or incomplete coursework. If you experience problems with your Internet connection while working on this course, it is your responsibility to find an alternative Internet access point, such as a public library or Wi-Fi ® hotspot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Mixed Content&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site is considered a secure web site which means that your connection is encrypted.  We do however link to content that isn&#039;t necessarily encrypted.  This is called mixed content.  By default, mixed content is blocked in Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome.  This may result in a blank page or a message saying that only secure content is displayed.  Follow the directions on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.e-education.psu.edu/techspecs&quot;&gt;Technical Requirements&lt;/a&gt; page to view the mixed content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Penn State E-mail Accounts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All official communications from the Penn State World Campus are sent to students&#039; Penn State e-mail accounts. Be sure to check your Penn State account regularly, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://pennstate.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&amp;amp;sys_id=88eb7db3db7ad70097c9ffe61d961963&quot;&gt;forward your Penn State e-mail &lt;/a&gt;to your preferred e-mail account, so you don&#039;t miss any important information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Academic Integrity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course follows&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ems.psu.edu/undergraduate/academic-advising/forms-and-procedures/academic-integrity&quot;&gt; Penn State&#039;s College of Earth and Mineral Sciences Academic Integrity Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. Penn State defines academic integrity as &quot;the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner.&quot; Academic integrity includes &quot;a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception.&quot; In particular, the University defines plagiarism as &quot;the fabrication of information and citations; submitting others&#039; work from professional journals, books, articles, and papers; submission of other students&#039; papers, lab results or project reports and representing the work as one&#039;s own.&quot; Penalties for violations of academic integrity may include course failure. To learn more, see Penn State&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://academicintegrity.psu.edu/&quot;&gt;Academic Integrity&lt;/a&gt; training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Course Copyright&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All course materials students receive or to which students have online access are protected by copyright laws. Students may use course materials and make copies for their own use as needed, but unauthorized distribution and/or uploading of materials without the instructor’s express permission is strictly prohibited. University Policy AD 40, the University Policy Recording of Classroom Activities and Note Taking Services addresses this issue. Students who engage in the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials may be held in violation of the University’s Code of Conduct, and/or liable under Federal and State laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, uploading completed labs, homework, or other assignments to any study site constitutes a violation of this policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Accommodations for Students with Disabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University&#039;s educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources&quot;&gt;Office for Student Disability Resources&lt;/a&gt; website provides contact information for &lt;a href=&quot;http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/campus-disability-coordinators&quot;&gt;Campus Disability Coordinators &lt;/a&gt;at every Penn State campus. For further information, please visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources&quot;&gt;Office for Student Disability Resources&lt;/a&gt; website&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled. You will participate in an intake interview and provide documentation. See documentation guidelines at &lt;a href=&quot;http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/applying-for-services&quot;&gt;Applying for Services from Student Disability Resources&lt;/a&gt;. If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Counseling and Psychological Services&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing.  The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings.  These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.  Services include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/counseling/&quot;&gt;Counseling and Psychological Services at University Park  (CAPS)&lt;/a&gt;: 814-863-0395&lt;br /&gt;
	Counseling Services at &lt;a href=&quot;http://senate.psu.edu/faculty/counseling-services-at-commonwealth-campuses/&quot;&gt;Commonwealth Campuses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Penn State Crisis Line (24 hours/7 days/week): 877-229-6400&lt;br /&gt;
	Crisis Text Line (24 hours/7 days/week): Text LIONS to 741741&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Reporting Bias-Motivated Incidents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin, race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated (&lt;a href=&quot;https://policy.psu.edu/policies/ad29&quot;&gt;Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance&lt;/a&gt;) and can be reported through Educational Equity via &lt;a href=&quot;http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/&quot;&gt;Report Bias&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Military Personnel&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veterans and currently serving military personnel and/or spouses with unique circumstances (e.g., upcoming deployments, drill/duty requirements, disabilities, VA appointments, etc.) are welcome and encouraged to communicate these, in advance if possible, to the instructor in the case that special arrangements need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Inclement Weather&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of weather-related delays at the University, this online course will proceed as planned. Your instructor will inform you if there are any extenuating circumstances regarding content or activity due dates in the course due to weather delays. If you are affected by a weather-related emergency, please contact your instructor at the earliest possible time to make special arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Connect Online with Caution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penn State is committed to educational access for all. Our students come from all walks of life and have diverse life experiences. As with any other online community, the lack of physical interaction in an online classroom can create a false sense of anonymity and security. While one can make new friends online, digital relationships can also be misleading. Good judgment and decision making are critical when choosing to disclose personal information to others whom you do not know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Deferred Grades&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are prevented from completing this course within the prescribed amount of time for reasons that are beyond your control, it is possible to have the grade deferred with the concurrence of the instructor, following &lt;a href=&quot;http://senate.psu.edu/policies-and-rules-for-undergraduate-students/47-00-48-00-and-49-00-grades/#48-40&quot;&gt;Penn State Deferred Grade Policy 48-40&lt;/a&gt;. To seek a deferred grade, you must submit a written request (by e-mail or U.S. post) to the  instructor describing the reason(s) for the request. Non-emergency permission for filing a deferred grade must be requested before the beginning of the final examination period.  It is up to the instructor to determine whether or not you will be permitted to receive a deferred grade. If permission is granted, you will work with the instructor to establish a communication plan and a clear schedule for completion within policy.  If for any reason, the coursework for the deferred grade is not complete by the assigned time, a grade of &quot;F&quot; will be automatically entered on your transcript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;attendance&quot;&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;Attendance&lt;/h4&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;This course will be conducted entirely online. There will be no set class meeting times, but you will be required to complete weekly assignments with specific due dates. Many of the assignments are open for multiple days, so it is your responsibility to complete the work early if you plan to travel or participate in national holidays, religious observances or University approved activities.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;If you need to request an exception due to a personal or medical emergency, contact the instructor directly as soon as you are able. Such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Diversity, Inclusion, and Respect&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penn State is “committed to creating an educational environment which is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups and strives to create and maintain an environment that fosters respect for others” as stated in Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment and to interact with civility.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;color: #FF0000&quot;&gt;Instructions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please answer following questions below. We ask that you submit your answers in either a MSWord formatted document or in a plain-text file. Email your document to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:dbabb@ems.psu.edu&quot;&gt;dbabb@ems.psu.edu&lt;/a&gt;. We will evaluate your responses and notify you via return email of our assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note:&lt;/i&gt; We suggest that you print off this page (you may want to print/save some of the maps and images as well). You can save an image to your local hard drive by bringing up the image in the browser window and then clicking &quot;File-&amp;gt;Save As...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consider a &lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q01A.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;loop of IR images&lt;/a&gt; that spans from 1215Z to 1745Z on February 15, 2011.&amp;nbsp; Examining that image loop, you notice a strange shading reversal that takes place over Texas (One half the state seemingly goes from light to dark while the other half goes from dark to light).&amp;nbsp; This question will explore this oddity.
		&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-roman;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Start by briefly describinng how IR imagery is obtained.&amp;nbsp; Discuss what is being measured versus what is being displayed in this image.&amp;nbsp; What fundamental assumption do meteorolgists make when determining cloud top heights from IR imagery?&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Now, in a brief paragraph or two, describe what is transpiring meteorologically in this loop of IR images. To assist in your explanation, I have provided the beginning and ending frames from this loop (&lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q01B.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1215Z&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q01C.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1745Z&lt;/a&gt;) as still images (and reference points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;).&amp;nbsp; Please tailor your explanation for someone who is unfamiliar with basic meteorological conepts.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You are given station-model maps of Pennsylvania at &lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q02A.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;12Z&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q02B.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;13Z&lt;/a&gt; on December 11, 2002. Note that &quot;UNV&quot;, the three-letter station identifier for the University Park Airport in State College, Pennsylvania, marks the corresponding station model on both maps.
		&lt;p&gt;You are also given an observed skew-T (at 12Z) and three &lt;i&gt;forecast skew-T&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; (see table below). The three forecast skew-T&#039;s were valid at 13Z, 14Z and 17Z. They were based on a computer&#039;s prediction made at 12Z on December 11, 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;table class=&quot;table-data&quot; style=&quot;width: 70%;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;thead&gt;
				&lt;tr&gt;
					&lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Observed&lt;/th&gt;
					&lt;th colspan=&quot;3&quot; scope=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Forecast skew-T&lt;/th&gt;
				&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;/thead&gt;
			&lt;tbody&gt;
				&lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
						&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q02C.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;12Z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q02D.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;13Z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q02E.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;14Z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q02F.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;17Z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;/tr&gt;
				&lt;/tbody&gt;
			&lt;/table&gt;
		
		&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-roman;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;You are given a &lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q02G.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;national radar image&lt;/a&gt; at 12Z on December 11, 2002. The large shield of precipitation in the East was advancing steadily to the northeast. The white dot marks the location of the University Park Airport. Given the intensity of the radar echo over University Park Airport, explain why the 12Z map of station models indicates that no precipitation was reported at 12Z at UNV (precipitation was not reaching the ground). In your discussion, include reason(s) why precipitation was not reported at the surface. As before, your answer should efficiently and effectively explain relevant concepts leading to this occurrence.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Now compare the 12Z skew-T to the forecast skew-T&#039;s at 13Z and 14Z. There is obviously a difference in appearance between the 12Z skew-T and the 13Z skew-T, as well as the 13Z skew-T compared to the 14Z skew-T. The differences are most notable in the &lt;b&gt;lower troposphere&lt;/b&gt;. How and why did the lowest layers evolve from the 12Z skew-T into the 13Z and 14Z skew-T&#039;s? Please reference specific times and temperatures in your explanation and focus on relevant meteorological concepts which led to the changes in both the temperature and dew point soundings between 12Z and 14Z.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Precipitation was first reported at UNV at 15Z. Was precipitation falling at 17Z? Briefly but cogently explain. Use the 17Z forecast skew-T to support your answer.&amp;nbsp; If your answer was &quot;yes&quot; please include a descussion of what form the precipitation took.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The great snowstorm on the weekend before Presidents&#039; Day 2003 had a very humble beginning. To see the humility of the storm&#039;s beginning, you are given the &lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q03A.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;surface&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q03B.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;500-mb&lt;/a&gt; analyses at 00Z on February 16, 2003.&amp;nbsp; On the surface map, note the early stages of the cyclone as the embryonic low starts to take shape over Louisiana at an unimpressive 1007 mb.&amp;nbsp; This question will explore the early intensification of this storm.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-roman;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;!-- Part 4i --&gt;You are given the &lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q03C.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;500-mb analysis of absolute vorticity&lt;/a&gt; at 00Z on February 16, 2003. What is the most likely position of the &quot;vort max&quot; in the southern branch of strong 500-mb winds that&#039;s directly associated with the early stages of the surface low over Louisiana? To answer this question, you must address each of the following issues:
				&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Give a specific geographical location of the vort max. You must pinpoint the location of the vort max with a specific reference to the &lt;b&gt;region of a state&lt;/b&gt; (for example, &quot;northwest Oregon&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;What&#039;s the full name of the &quot;feature&quot; on the &lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q03D.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;500-mb analysis&lt;/a&gt; that&#039;s directly linked to the &quot;vort max&quot; (this name describes what the feature is and how big it is)?&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Imagine a parcel of air at the center of the 500-mb &quot;vort max&quot;. Now imagine riding along with the parcel in time. Discuss the &lt;b&gt;two&lt;/b&gt; physical changes that the parcel undergoes as it approaches the surface low in Louisiana. You must be very specific here.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;In light of these physical changes, what process does the parcel undergo to the east of 500-mb vort max?&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;What impact does this process have on surface pressures over eastern Louisiana? Explain, bringing a representative air column into your discussion. Limit your explanation to a single paragraph.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Look at the &lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q03E.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;12Z surface analysis&lt;/a&gt; on February 16, 2003. Identify a region of strong cold air advection located near the developing low pressure and describe how you arrived at this answer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Finally, describe in no more than two paragraphs how cold advection in this region acts as a positve feedback mechanism helping to intensify the low pressure system.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You are given the &lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q04A.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;24-hour prog&lt;/a&gt; from a computer model.
		&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-roman;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;What is the prog&#039;s initialization time? What is its valid time?&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Describe what data fields appear on each panel of the 4-panel prog?&amp;nbsp; State why are each of these variables are important to the forecaster.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;A television weathercaster in &lt;a href=&quot;http://pics2.city-data.com/city/maps/fr370.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; is using this prog in order to make a local forecast its valid time, and asks you for help. Incorporating the information from this prog, help the weathercaster to formulate a precipitation forecast (onset, amount, and type) for Wilkes-Barre/Scranton for the prog&#039;s valid time. Please be advised that your answer cannot exceed the precision of the forecast prog you are given.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Later that evening around 10 P.M., the weathercaster looked at the &lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q04B.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;12-hour&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/assessments/projects/P00_Q04C.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;18-hour&lt;/a&gt; progs from the latest model run.
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;On the 11 P.M. news, should the weathercaster adjust his/your forecast cited in part iii? If so, why? You must cite specific evidence to support your claim.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If no adjustments to timing are necessary, explain your reasoning in one or two cogent sentences.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;If an adjustment is necessary, how should the weathercaster adjust his timing? What should he say on-air about the starting time of precipitation at Scranton? Again, to support your answer, you must cite specific evidence from the prog&#039;s forecast for precipitation. Please be advised that your answer cannot exceed the precision of the forecast prog you are given.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-2 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;ShowHide:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/meteo3/taxonomy/term/1&quot;&gt;Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;box-note&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This course is offered as part of the Open Educational Resources initiative of Penn State&#039;s John A. Dutton e-Education Institute. You are welcome to use and re-use materials that appear in this site (other than those copyrighted by others) subject to the licensing agreement linked to the bottom of this and every page.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Registered&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;METEO&lt;/em&gt; 3 students should enter the course through their course section in Canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not registered?&lt;/strong&gt; Students who register for this Penn State course gain access to assignments and instructor feedback, as well as earn academic credit. Information about registering for this course is available at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Penn State World Campus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Quick Facts about &lt;em&gt;METEO 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;METEO&lt;/em&gt; 3 is a General Education course offered by the Department of Meteorology. The course is designed specifically for distance learners seeking general science credit. &lt;em&gt;METEO&lt;/em&gt; 3 will introduce to you a wide variety of basic atmospheric concepts so that you can become a better &quot;weather consumer&quot; (better understand and evaluate weather information) and gain a better understanding of &quot;how the weather works.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Why learn about the atmosphere?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-right-35&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Portrait of Benjamin Franklin&quot; src=&quot;/meteo3/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.meteo3/files/images/lesson0/franklinwithkey.jpg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;&quot;Benjamin Franklin Drawing Electricity from the Sky&quot; by Benjamin West (1738-1820).&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class=&quot;image-credit&quot;&gt;Phil. Mus. of Art&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most everyone is familiar with Benjamin Franklin&#039;s foray into cloud electrification using a kite. However, did you know that Franklin was an avid student of the weather? He was the first person to note that storms generally traveled from west to east at predictable speeds. Franklin also noted in 1743 that storms do not always travel in the direction of the prevailing winds - in fact can travel &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the prevailing winds in some cases!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, Benjamin Franklin dabbled in many diverse topics, but why did he find the study of weather so important? Perhaps Franklin found the weather to be so important because it so profoundly affects &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;. Think about it. No matter where you live or what you do, weather is going to have some impact on your life. Weather helps determine the types of clothes we wear, may impact your source of income, and on rare occasions, it may affect your very health and safety (think about extreme events like hurricanes, tornadoes, or floods). In whatever way the weather affects you, one thing is for sure… the weather &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; affect you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then, doesn&#039;t it make sense to know something about how the atmosphere works and make use of the many types of weather data available to you? I certainly think so! However, I am continually startled that a lot of people know so very little about something that plays such a pivotal role in their lives. Indeed, many people are interested &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the weather, but not necessarily interested in learning &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the weather. Hopefully, as a result of this course, you will come away with some very practical knowledge about the weather. This knowledge will make you a better weather consumer (that is, someone who can intelligently process weather information presented to you). And, who knows, this knowledge may even save your life! In the words of Ben Franklin, you&#039;ll be &quot;weather-wise.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What will you learn in this course?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;METEO&lt;/em&gt; 3 seeks to give you a better understanding of atmospheric structure and processes so you can better apply the weather information you encounter. With this knowledge of how the atmosphere works, you&#039;ll be able to understand what controls the evolution of storms and appreciate why weather forecasts are sometimes highly uncertain. You will also learn to &quot;read&quot; the sky so you can make your own short-term forecasts and adjust your behavior accordingly. You will also be better able to assess the validity of the commonly expressed concerns about climate change and deteriorating air quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 1: A Meteorologist&#039;s Toolbox&lt;/strong&gt; (applications of meteorology, composition of the atmosphere,&amp;nbsp;UTC and common U.S. time zones, temperature scales, observations and&amp;nbsp;station models, common statistical measures (range, mean, and normal), map features (latitude lines, meridians and projections), reading isoplethed maps, gradients)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How does this course work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;METEO&lt;/em&gt; 3 uses an online text, which includes digital video, audio, simulation models, virtual field trips to on-line data resources, and interactive quizzes that provide instantaneous feedback. The course consists of 12 lessons, plus a course orientation week at the beginning of the semester.
